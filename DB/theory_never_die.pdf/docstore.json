To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about\nlearning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok. In the\nfirst-ever account of Bayes\u2019 rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch\nMcGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the human obsessions\nsurrounding it. She traces its discovery by an amateur mathematician in the\n1740s through its development into roughly its modern form by French\nscientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why respected statisticians\nrendered it professionally taboo for 150 years\u2014at the same time that", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f5a4b4c-d514-4b59-9bd3-5e9db95eecde": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f5a4b4c-d514-4b59-9bd3-5e9db95eecde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3ad0e26b-5623-4b30-848d-69567c7832eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "b0f165521a9521c87fdbf20a864c75d8c5b80e04d074454e99db8b8b8025198f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving great uncertainty and\nscanty information, even breaking Germany\u2019s Enigma code during World War\nII, and explains how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in the\n1980s proved to be a game-changer.

It concerned a broader and more fundamental issue:\nhow we analyze evidence, change our minds as we get new information, and\nmake rational decisions in the face of uncertainty. And it was not resolved\nuntil the dawn of the twenty-first century.\nOn its face Bayes\u2019 rule is a simple, one-line theorem: by updating our\ninitial belief about something with objective new information, we get a new\nand improved belief. To its adherents, this is an elegant statement about\nlearning from experience. Generations of converts remember experiencing an\nalmost religious epiphany as they fell under the spell of its inner logic.\nOpponents, meanwhile, regarded Bayes\u2019 rule as subjectivity run amok.\nBayes\u2019 rule began life amid an inflammatory religious controversy in\nEngland in the 1740s: can we make rational conclusions about God based on\nevidence about the world around us? An amateur mathematician, the\nReverend Thomas Bayes, discovered the rule, and we celebrate him today as\nthe iconic father of mathematical decision making. Yet Bayes consigned his\ndiscovery to oblivion. In his time, he was a minor figure. And we know\nabout his work today only because of his friend and editor Richard Price, an\nalmost forgotten hero of the American Revolution.\nBy rights, Bayes\u2019 rule should be named for someone else: a Frenchman,\nPierre Simon Laplace, one of the most powerful mathematicians and\nscientists in history. To deal with an unprecedented torrent of data, Laplace\ndiscovered the rule on his own in 1774. Over the next forty years he\ndeveloped it into the form we use today. Applying his method, he concluded\nthat a well-established fact\u2014more boys are born than girls\u2014was almost", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1966, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11b98989-5713-4a5d-b688-40db40d858ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "11b98989-5713-4a5d-b688-40db40d858ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7f6f760-d9fd-47a3-87fc-37b2936640c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "4d0618ff7ae71a3fcafc55f55b32b4a17fd8d46c0715f4f10fde1f17aa868cc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "certainly the result of natural law. Only historical convention forces us to call\nLaplace\u2019s discovery Bayes\u2019 rule.\nAfter Laplace\u2019s death, researchers and academics seeking precise and\nobjective answers pronounced his method subjective, dead, and buried. Yet\nat the very same time practical problem solvers relied on it to deal with real-\nworld emergencies. One spectacular success occurred during the Second\nWorld War, when Alan Turing developed Bayes to break Enigma, the German\nnavy\u2019s secret code, and in the process helped to both save Britain and invent\nmodern electronic computers and software. Other leading mathematical\nthinkers\u2014Andrei Kolmogorov in Russia and Claude Shannon in New York\n\u2014also rethought Bayes for wartime decision making.\nDuring the years when ivory tower theorists thought they had rendered\nBayes taboo, it helped start workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the United\nStates; save the Bell Telephone system from the financial panic of 1907;\ndeliver Alfred Dreyfus from a French prison; direct Allied artillery fire and\nlocate German U-boats; and locate earthquake epicenters and deduce\n(erroneously) that Earth\u2019s core consists of molten iron.\nTheoretically, Bayes\u2019 rule was verboten. But it could deal with all kinds\nof data, whether copious or sparse. During the Cold War, Bayes helped find a\nmissing H-bomb and U.S. and Russian submarines; investigate nuclear power\nplant safety; predict the shuttle Challenger tragedy; demonstrate that smoking\ncauses lung cancer and that high cholesterol causes heart attacks; predict\npresidential winners on television\u2019s most popular news program, and much\nmore.\nHow could otherwise rational scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians\nbecome so obsessed about a theorem that their argument became, as one\nobserver called it, a massive food fight? The answer is simple. At its heart,\nBayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that modern science\nrequires objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief. And it says\nthat we can learn even from missing and inadequate data, from\napproximations, and from ignorance.\nAs a result of this profound philosophical disagreement, Bayes\u2019 rule is a\nflesh-and-blood story about a small group of beleaguered believers who\nstruggled for legitimacy and acceptance for most of the twentieth century. It\u2019s\nabout how the rule\u2019s fate got entwined with the secrecy of the Second World\nWar and the Cold War. It\u2019s about a theorem in want of a computer and a\nsoftware package.

By Bayes\u2019 time, mathematics was split along religious and political\nlines, and many productive mathematicians were amateurs because, as\nDissenters, they were barred from English universities.1\nUnable to earn a degree in England, Bayes studied theology and\npresumably mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in Presbyterian\nScotland, where, happily for him, academic standards were much more\nrigorous. In 1711 he left for London, where his clergyman father ordained\nhim and apparently employed him as an assistant minister.\nPersecution turned many English Dissenters into feisty critics, and in his\nlate 20s Bayes took a stand on a hot theological issue: can the presence of\nevil be reconciled with God\u2019s presumed beneficence? In 1731 he wrote a\npamphlet\u2014a kind of blog\u2014declaring that God gives people \u201cthe greatest\nhappiness of which they are capable.\u201d\nDuring his 40s, Bayes\u2019 interests in mathematics and theology began to\ntightly intertwine. An Irish-Anglican bishop\u2014George Berkeley, for whom\nthe University of California\u2019s flagship campus is named\u2014published an\ninflammatory pamphlet attacking Dissenting mathematicians, calculus,\nabstract mathematics, the revered Isaac Newton, and all other \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d\nand \u201cinfidel mathematicians\u201d who believed that reason could illuminate any\nsubject. Berkeley\u2019s pamphlet was the most spectacular event in British\nmathematics during the 1700s.\nLeaping into the pamphlet wars again, Bayes published a piece defending\nand explaining Newton\u2019s calculus. This was his only mathematical\npublication during his lifetime. Shortly thereafter, in 1742, five men,\nincluding a close friend of Newton\u2019s, nominated Bayes for membership in the\nRoyal Society. His nomination avoided any hint of controversy and described\nhim as \u201ca Gentleman of known merit, well skilled in Geometry and all parts\nof Mathematical and Philosophical Learning.\u201d The Royal Society was not the\nprofessional organization it is today; it was a private organization of dues-\npaying amateurs from the landed gentry. But it played a vital role because\namateurs would produce some of the era\u2019s breakthroughs.\nAbout this time Bayes joined a second group of up-to-date amateur\nmathematicians.

At some point Bayes joined the network. One day, for example,\nStanhope sent Bayes a copy of a draft paper by a mathematician named\nPatrick Murdoch.

In criticizing concepts about cause and effect Hume was\nundermining Christianity\u2019s core beliefs.\nHume\u2019s essay was nonmathematical, but it had profound scientific\nimplications. Many mathematicians and scientists believed fervently that\nnatural laws did indeed prove the existence of God, their First Cause.

Today, probability, the\nmathematics of uncertainty, would be the obvious tool, but during the early\n1700s probability barely existed. Its only extensive application was to\ngambling, where it dealt with such basic issues as the odds of getting four\naces in one poker hand. De Moivre, who had spent several years in French\nprisons because he was a Protestant, had already solved that problem by\nworking from cause to effect. But no one had figured out how to turn his work\naround backward to ask the so-called inverse question from effect to cause:\nwhat if a poker player deals himself four aces in each of three consecutive\nhands? What is the underlying chance (or cause) that his deck is loaded?\nWe don\u2019t know precisely what piqued Bayes\u2019 interest in the inverse\nprobability problem. He had read de Moivre\u2019s book, and the Earl of\nStanhope was interested in probability as it applied to gambling.\nAlternatively, it could have been the broad issues raised by Newton\u2019s theory\nof gravitation. Newton, who had died 20 years before, had stressed the\nimportance of relying on observations, developed his theory of gravitation to\nexplain them, and then used his theory to predict new observations. But\nNewton had not explained the cause of gravity or wrestled with the problem\nof how true his theory might be.

To quantify the problem, he needed a\nnumber, and sometime between 1746 and 1749 he hit on an ingenious\nsolution. As a starting point he would simply invent a number\u2014he called it a\nguess\u2014and refine it later as he gathered more information.\nNext, he devised a thought experiment, a 1700s version of a computer\nsimulation. Stripping the problem to its basics, Bayes imagined a square\ntable so level that a ball thrown on it would have the same chance of landing\non one spot as on any other. Subsequent generations would call his\nconstruction a billiard table, but as a Dissenting minister Bayes would have\ndisapproved of such games, and his experiment did not involve balls\nbouncing off table edges or colliding with one another. As he envisioned it, a\nball rolled randomly on the table could stop with equal probability\nanywhere.\nWe can imagine him sitting with his back to the table so he cannot see\nanything on it. On a piece of paper he draws a square to represent the surface\nof the table. He begins by having an associate toss an imaginary cue ball onto\nthe pretend tabletop. Because his back is turned, Bayes does not know where\nthe cue ball has landed.\nNext, we picture him asking his colleague to throw a second ball onto the\ntable and report whether it landed to the right or left of the cue ball. If to the\nleft, Bayes realizes that the cue ball is more likely to sit toward the right side\nof the table. Again Bayes\u2019 friend throws the ball and reports only whether it\nlands to the right or left of the cue ball. If to the right, Bayes realizes that the\ncue can\u2019t be on the far right-hand edge of the table.\nHe asks his colleague to make throw after throw after throw; gamblers and\nmathematicians already knew that the more times they tossed a coin, the more\ntrustworthy their conclusions would be. What Bayes discovered is that, as\nmore and more balls were thrown, each new piece of information made his\nimaginary cue ball wobble back and forth within a more limited area.\nAs an extreme case, if all the subsequent tosses fell to the right of the first\nball, Bayes would have to conclude that it probably sat on the far left-hand\nmargin of his table.

In his own words, he decided to make \u201ca\nguess whereabouts it\u2019s [sic] probability is, and . . . [then] see the chance that\nthe guess is right.\u201d Future critics would be horrified at the idea of using a\nmere hunch\u2014a subjective belief\u2014in objective and rigorous mathematics.\nEven worse, Bayes added that if he did not know enough to distinguish the\nposition of the balls on his table, he would assume they were equally likely\nto fall anywhere on it. Assuming equal probabilities was a pragmatic\napproach for dealing with uncertain circumstances. The practice was rooted\nin traditional Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s ban on usury. In\nuncertain situations such as annuities or marine insurance policies, all parties\nwere assigned equal shares and divided profits equally. Even prominent\nmathematicians assigned equal probabilities to gambling odds by assuming,\nwith a remarkable lack of realism, that all tennis players or fighting cocks\nwere equally skillful.\nIn time, the practice of assigning equal probabilities acquired a number of\nnames, including equal priors, equal a priori\u2019s, equiprobability, uniform\ndistribution probability, and the law of insufficient reason (meaning that\nwithout enough data to assign specific probabilities, equal ones would\nsuffice). Despite their venerable history, equal probabilities would become a\nlightning rod for complaints that Bayes was quantifying ignorance.\nToday, some historians try to absolve him by saying he may have applied\nequal probabilities to his data (the subsequent throws) rather than to the\ninitial, so-called prior toss. But this is also guesswork. And for many\nworking statisticians, the question is irrelevant because in the tightly\ncircumscribed case of balls that can roll anywhere on a carefully leveled\nsurface both produce the same mathematical results.\nWhatever Bayes meant, the damage was done. For years to come, the\nmessage seemed clear: priors be damned. At this point, Bayes ended his\ndiscussion.\nHe may have mentioned his discovery to others.

No matter who talked about it, it seems\nhighly unlikely that anyone other than Bayes made the breakthrough.

If there had been any question about the author\u2019s identity,\nit is hard to imagine Bayes\u2019 editor or his publisher not saying something\npublicly. Thirty years later Price was still referring to the work as that of\nThomas Bayes.\nAlthough Bayes\u2019 idea was discussed in Royal Society circles, he himself\nseems not to have believed in it. Instead of sending it off to the Royal Society\nfor publication, he buried it among his papers, where it sat for roughly a\ndecade. Only because he filed it between memoranda dated 1746 and 1749\ncan we conclude that he achieved his breakthrough sometime during the late\n1740s, perhaps shortly after the publication of Hume\u2019s essay in 1748.\nBayes\u2019 reason for suppressing his essay can hardly have been fear of\ncontroversy; he had plunged twice into Britain\u2019s pamphlet wars. Perhaps he\nthought his discovery was useless; but if a pious clergyman like Bayes\nthought his work could prove the existence of God, surely he would have\npublished it. Some thought Bayes was too modest. Others wondered whether\nhe was unsure about his mathematics.

The modern convention of employing\nBayes\u2019 name alone is unfair but so entrenched that anything else makes little\nsense.\nAlthough it was ignored for years, Bayes\u2019 solution to the inverse\nprobability of causes was a masterpiece. He transformed probability from a\ngambler\u2019s measure of frequency into a measure of informed belief. A card\nplayer could start by believing his opponent played with a straight deck and\nthen modify his opinion each time a new hand was dealt. Eventually, the\ngambler could wind up with a better assessment of his opponent\u2019s honesty.\nBayes combined judgments based on prior hunches with probabilities\nbased on repeatable experiments. He introduced the signature features of\nBayesian methods: an initial belief modified by objective new information.\nHe could move from observations of the world to abstractions about their\nprobable cause. And he discovered the long-sought grail of probability, what\nfuture mathematicians would call the probability of causes, the principle of\ninverse probability, Bayesian statistics, or simply Bayes\u2019 rule.\nGiven the revered status of his work today, it is also important to\nrecognize what Bayes did not do. He did not produce the modern version of\nBayes\u2019 rule. He did not even employ an algebraic equation; he used\nNewton\u2019s old-fashioned geometric notation to calculate and add areas. Nor\ndid he develop his theorem into a powerful mathematical method. Above all,\nunlike Price, he did not mention Hume, religion, or God.\nInstead, he cautiously confined himself to the probability of events and did\nnot mention hypothesizing, predicting, deciding, or taking action. He did not\nsuggest possible uses for his work, whether in theology, science, or social\nscience. Future generations would extend Bayes\u2019 discovery to do all these\nthings and to solve a myriad of practical problems. Bayes did not even name\nhis breakthrough. It would be called the probability of causes or inverse\nprobability for the next 200 years. It would not be named Bayesian until the\n1950s.\nIn short, Bayes took the first steps.

A trio of\nFrench astronomers, Alexis Claude Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-\nReine Lepaute, the wife of a celebrated clockmaker, solved a difficult three-\nbody problem and discovered that the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn\nwould delay the arrival of Halley\u2019s comet.

Years later Laplace said it was the event that made his\ngeneration realize that extraordinary events like comets, eclipses, and severe\ndroughts were caused not by divine anger but by natural laws that\nmathematics could reveal.\nLaplace\u2019s extraordinary mathematical ability may not yet have been\napparent when he turned 17 in 1766, because he did not go to the University\nof Paris, which had a strong science faculty. Instead he went to the University\nof Caen, which was closer to home and had a solid theological program\nsuitable for a future cleric.\nYet even Caen had mathematical firebrands offering advanced lectures on\ndifferential and integral calculus.

Laplace emerged from Caen a swashbuckling mathematical virtuoso\neager to take on the scientific world. He had also become, no doubt to his\nfather\u2019s horror, a religious skeptic.\nAt graduation Laplace faced an anguishing dilemma. His master\u2019s degree\npermitted him to take either the priestly vows of celibacy or the title of abb\u00e9,\nsignifying a low-ranking clergyman who could marry and inherit property.\nAbb\u00e9s did not have good reputations; Voltaire called them \u201cthat indefinable\nbeing which is neither ecclesiastic nor secular . . . young men, who are\nknown for their debauchery.\u201d3 An engraving of the period, \u201cWhat Does the\nAbb\u00e9 Think of It?\u201d shows the clergyman peering appreciatively down a\nlady\u2019s bosom as she dresses.4 Still, the elder Laplace wanted his son to\nbecome a clergyman.\nIf Laplace had been willing to become an abb\u00e9, his father might have\nhelped him financially, and Laplace could have combined church and\nscience. A number of abb\u00e9s supported themselves in science, the most\nfamous being Jean Antoine Nollet, who demonstrated spectacular physics\nexperiments to the paying public. For the edification of the king and queen of\nFrance, Nollet sent a charge of static electricity through a line of 180\nsoldiers to make them leap comically into the air. Two abb\u00e9s were even\nelected to the prestigious Royal Academy of Sciences. Still, the lot of most\nabb\u00e9-scientists was neither lucrative nor intellectually challenging. The\nmajority found low-level jobs tutoring the sons of rich nobles or teaching\nelementary mathematics and science in secondary schools. University-level\nopportunities were limited because during the 1700s professors transmitted\nknowledge from the past instead of doing original research.\nBut Caen had convinced Laplace that he wanted to do something quite\nnew. He wanted to be a full-time, professional, secular, mathematical\nresearcher. And he wanted to explore the new algebra-generated, data-rich\nworld of science. To his father, an ambitious man in bucolic France, a career\nin mathematics must have seemed preposterous.\nYoung Laplace made his move in the summer of 1769, shortly after\ncompleting his studies at Caen. He left Normandy and traveled to Paris,\nclutching a letter of recommendation to Jean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert, the most\npowerful mathematician of the age, one of Europe\u2019s most notorious\nanticlerics, and the object of almost incessant Jesuit attacks.

We can\nonly imagine his father\u2019s reaction, but we know that Laplace did not return\nhome for 20 years and did not attend the old man\u2019s funeral.\nOnce in Paris, Laplace immediately approached the great d\u2019Alembert and\nshowed him a four-page student essay on inertia. Years later Laplace could\nstill recite passages from it. Although besieged by applicants, d\u2019Alembert\nwas so impressed that within days he had arranged a paying job for Laplace\nas an instructor of mathematics at the new secular, mathematics-based Royal\nMilitary School for the younger sons of minor nobles. The school, located\nbehind Les Invalides in Paris, provided Laplace with a salary, housing,\nmeals, and money for wood to heat his room in winter. It was precisely the\nkind of job he had hoped to avoid.\nLaplace could have tried to find work applying mathematics to practical\nproblems in one of the monarchy\u2019s numerous research establishments or\nmanufacturing plants. Many mathematically talented young men from modest\nfamilies were employed in such institutions. But Laplace and his mentor\nwere aiming far higher. Laplace wanted the challenge of doing basic research\nfull time. And to do that, as d\u2019Alembert must have told him, he had to get\nelected to the Royal Academy of Sciences.\nIn striking contrast to the amateurism of the Royal Society of London, the\nFrench Royal Academy of Sciences was the most professional scientific\ninstitution in Europe. Although aristocratic amateurs could become honorary\nmembers, the organization\u2019s highest ranks were composed of working\nscientists chosen by merit and paid to observe, collect, and investigate facts\nfree of dogma; to publish their findings after peer review; and to advise the\ngovernment on technical issues like patents. To augment their low salaries,\nacademicians could use their prestige to cobble together various part-time\njobs.\nWithout financial support from the church or his father, however, Laplace\nhad to work fast. Since most academy members were chosen on the basis of a\nlong record of solid accomplishment, he would have to be elected over the\nheads of more senior men. And for that to happen, he needed to make a\nspectacular impact.\nD\u2019Alembert, who had made Newton\u2019s revolution the focus of French\nmathematics, urged Laplace to concentrate on astronomy.

But Newton had described the motions of\nheavenly bodies roughly and without explanation.

In a paper submitted and read to the academy in\nMarch, the former abb\u00e9 compared ignorant mankind, not with God but with\nan imaginary intelligence capable of knowing All. Because humans can never\nknow everything with certainty, probability is the mathematical expression of\nour ignorance: \u201cWe owe to the frailty of the human mind one of the most\ndelicate and ingenious of mathematical theories, namely the science of\nchance or probabilities.\u201d7\nThe essay was a grand combination of mathematics, metaphysics, and the\nheavens that Laplace held to his entire life. His search for a probability of\ncauses and his view of the deity were deeply congenial. Laplace was all of\none piece and for that reason all the more formidable. He often said he did\nnot believe in God, and not even his biographer could decide whether he was\nan atheist or a deist.

Dusting off one of his discarded\nmanuscripts, Laplace transformed it into a broad method for determining the\nmost likely causes of events and phenomena. He called it \u201cM\u00e9moire on the\nProbability of the Causes Given Events.\u201d\nIt provided the first version of what today we call Bayes\u2019 rule, Bayesian\nprobability, or Bayesian statistical inference. Not yet recognizable as the\nmodern Bayes\u2019 rule, it was a one-step process for moving backward, or\ninversely, from an effect to its most likely cause.

He intuited it as a principle\nand described it only in words: the probability of a cause (given an event) is\nproportional to the probability of the event (given its cause). Laplace did not\ntranslate his theory into algebra at this point, but modern readers might find it\nhelpful to see what his statement would look like today:\n where P(C|E) is the probability of a particular cause (given the data), and\nP(E|C) represents the probability of an event or datum (given that cause). The\nsign in the denominator represented with Newton\u2019s sigma sign makes the\ntotal probability of all possible causes add up to one.\nArmed with his principle, Laplace could do everything Thomas Bayes\ncould have done\u2014as long as he accepted the restrictive assumption that all\nhis possible causes or hypotheses were equally likely. Laplace\u2019s goal,\nhowever, was far more ambitious. As a scientist, he needed to study the\nvarious possible causes of a phenomenon and then determine the best one. He\ndid not yet know how to do that mathematically. He would need to make two\nmore major breakthroughs and spend decades in thought.\nLaplace\u2019s principle, the proportionality between probable events and their\nprobable causes, seems simple today.

First, he imagined an urn filled with an unknown ratio of\nblack and white tickets (his cause). He drew a number of tickets from the urn\nand, based on that experience, asked for the probability that his next ticket\nwould be white. Then in a frustrating battle to prove the answer he wrote no\nfewer than 45 equations covering four quarto-sized pages.\nHis second gambling problem involved piquet, a game requiring both luck\nand skill.

Again, Laplace understood instinctively how to solve the\nproblem but could not yet do so mathematically.\nAfter dealing with gambling, which he loathed, Laplace moved happily on\nto the critical scientific problem faced by working astronomers. How should\nthey deal with different observations of the same phenomenon? Three of the\nera\u2019s biggest scientific problems involved gravitational attraction on the\nmotions of our moon, the motions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, and the\nshape of the Earth. Even if observers repeated their measurements at the\nsame time and place with the same instrument, their results could be slightly\ndifferent each time. Trying to calculate a midvalue for such discrepant\nobservations, Laplace limited himself to three observations but still needed\nseven pages of equations to formulate the problem. Scientifically, he\nunderstood the right answer\u2014average the three data points\u2014but he would\nhave no mathematical justification for doing so until 1810, when, without\nusing the probability of causes, he invented the central limit theorem.\nAlthough Bayes originated the probability of causes, Laplace clearly\ndiscovered his version on his own. Laplace was 15 when the Bayes-Price\nessay was published; it appeared in an English-language journal for the\nEnglish gentry and was apparently never mentioned again. Even French\nscientists who kept up with foreign journals thought Laplace was first and\ncongratulated him wholeheartedly on his originality.\nMathematics confirms that Laplace discovered the principle\nindependently. Bayes solved a special problem about a flat table using a\ntwo-step process that involved a prior guess and new data. Laplace did not\nyet know about the initial guess but dealt with the problem generally, making\nit useful for a variety of problems. Bayes laboriously explained and\nillustrated why uniform probabilities were permissible; Laplace assumed\nthem instinctively. The Englishman wanted to know the range of probabilities\nthat something will happen in light of previous experience. Laplace wanted\nmore: as a working scientist, he wanted to know the probability that certain\nmeasurements and numerical values associated with a phenomenon were\nrealistic. If Bayes and Price searched for the probability that, on the basis of\ntoday\u2019s puddles, it had rained yesterday and would rain tomorrow, Laplace\nasked for the probability that a particular amount of rain would fall and then\nrefined his opinion over and over with new information to get a better value.\nLaplace\u2019s method was immensely influential; scientists did not pay Bayes\nserious heed until the twentieth century.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2644, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3b2595b-2edb-4c1a-a60c-bbac476ff511": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3b2595b-2edb-4c1a-a60c-bbac476ff511", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df51ea1d-b68b-497d-b9c6-60a4306b060c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "c8541fccbf64183b62fb2bc7fdfae30cb698ae29bf50d5478155b58ba5391345", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Most strikingly of all, Laplace at 25 was already steadfastly determined to\ndevelop his new method and make it useful.

He also made important\nadvances in celestial mechanics, mathematics, physics, biology, Earth\nscience, and statistics. He juggled projects, moving from one to another and\nthen back to the first. Happily blazing trails through every field of science\nknown to his age, he transformed and mathematized everything he touched.\nHe never stopped being thrilled by examples of Newton\u2019s theory.\nAlthough he was fast becoming the leading scientist of his era, the\nacademy waited five years before electing him a member on March 31, 1773.\nA few weeks later he was formally inducted into the world\u2019s leading\nscientific organization. His m\u00e9moire on the probability of causes was\npublished a year later, in 1774. At the age of 24, Laplace was a professional\nresearcher. The academy\u2019s annual stipend, together with his teaching salary,\nwould help support him while he refined his research on celestial mechanics\nand the probability of causes.\nLaplace was still grappling with probability in 1781, when Richard Price\nvisited Paris and told Condorcet about Bayes\u2019 discovery. Laplace\nimmediately latched onto the Englishman\u2019s ingenious invention, the starting\nguess, and incorporated it into his own, earlier version of the probability of\ncauses. Strictly speaking, he did not produce a new formula but rather a\nstatement about the first formula assuming equal probabilities for the causes.\nThe statement gave him confidence that he was on the right track and told him\nthat as long as all his prior hypotheses were equally probable, his earlier\nprinciple of 1774 was correct.8\nLaplace could now confidently marry his intuitive grasp of a scientific\nsituation with the eighteenth century\u2019s passion for new and precise scientific\ndiscoveries. Every time he got new information he could use the answer from\nhis last solution as the starting point for another calculation.

If his method was ever going to reflect the actual\nstate of affairs, he needed to be able to differentiate dubious data from more\nvalid observations. Calling all events or observations equally probable\ncould be true only theoretically. Many dice, for example, that appeared\nperfectly cubed were actually skewed.

But to illustrate how tedious calculations with big numbers could\nbe, he described multiplying 20,000 \u00d7 19,999 \u00d7 19,998 \u00d7 19,997, etc. and\nthen dividing by 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 up to 10,000.

But astronomy seldom provided\nextensive or controlled data, and the social sciences often involved so many\npossible causes that algebraic equations were useless.\nOnly one large amalgamation of truly trustworthy numbers existed in the\n1700s: parish records of births, christenings, marriages, and deaths. In 1771\nthe French government ordered all provincial officials to report birth and\ndeath figures regularly to Paris; and three years later, the Royal Academy\npublished 60 years of data for the Paris region. The figures confirmed what\nthe Englishman John Graunt had discovered in 1662: slightly more boys than\ngirls were born, in a ratio that remained constant over many years. Scientists\nhad long assumed that the ratio, like other newly discovered regularities in\nnature, must be the result of \u201cDivine Providence.\u201d Laplace disagreed.\nSoon he was assessing not gambling or astronomical statistics but infants.\nFor anyone interested in large numbers, babies were ideal. First, they came\nin binomials, either boys or girls, and eighteenth-century mathematicians\nalready knew how to treat binomials. Second, infants arrived in abundance\nand, as Laplace emphasized, \u201cIt is necessary in this delicate research to\nemploy sufficiently large numbers in view of the small difference that exists\nbetween . . . the births of boys and girls.\u201d12 When the great naturalist Comte\nde Buffon discovered a small village in Burgundy where, for five years\nrunning, more girls had been born than boys, he asked whether this village\ninvalidated Laplace\u2019s hypotheses. Absolutely not, Laplace replied firmly. A\nstudy based on a few facts cannot overrule a much larger one.\nThe calculations would be formidable. For example, if he had started with\na 52:48 ratio of newborn boys to girls and a sample of 58,000 boys, Laplace\nwould have had to multiply .52 by itself 57,999 times\u2014and then do a similar\ncalculation for girls.

Like a modern researcher, he competed and\ncollaborated with others and published reports on his interim progress as he\nwent. Above all, he was tenacious. Twenty-five years later he was still\neagerly testing his probability of causes with new information. He combed\n65 years\u2019 worth of orphanage registries, asked friends in Egypt and\nAlexander von Humboldt in Central America about birth ratios there, and\ncalled on naturalists to check the animal kingdom. Finally, in 1812, after\ndecades of work, he cautiously concluded that the birth of more boys than\ngirls seemed to be \u201ca general law for the human race.\u201d18\nTo test his rule on a larger sample Laplace decided in 1781 to determine the\nsize of the French population, the thermometer of its health and prosperity. A\nconscientious administrator in eastern France had carefully counted heads in\nseveral parishes; to estimate the population of the entire nation, he\nrecommended multiplying the annual number of births in France by 26.

He was adjusting estimates\nof the nation\u2019s population with more precise information from particular\nregions. In 1786 he reached a figure closer to modern estimates and\ncalculated odds of 1,000 to 1 that his estimate was off by less than half a\nmillion. In 1802 he was able to advise Napoleon Bonaparte that a new\ncensus should be augmented with detailed samples of about a million\nresidents in 30 representative departments scattered equally around France.\nAs he worked on his birth and census studies during the monarchy\u2019s last\nyears, Laplace became involved in an inflammatory debate about France\u2019s\njudicial system. Condorcet believed the social sciences should be as\nquantifiable as the physical sciences. To help transform absolutist France\ninto an English-style constitutional monarchy, he wanted Laplace to use\nmathematics to explore a variety of issues. How confident can we be in a\nsentence handed down by judge or jury? How probable is it that voting by an\nassembly or judicial tribunal will establish the truth? Laplace agreed to\napply his new theory of probability to questions about electoral procedures,\nthe credibility of witnesses, decision making by judicial panels and juries,\nand procedures of representative bodies and judicial panels.\nLaplace took a dim view of most court judgments in France. Forensic\nscience did not exist, so judicial systems everywhere relied on witness\ntestimony. Taking a witness\u2019s statement for an event, Laplace asked the\nprobability that the witness or the judge might be truthful, misled, or simply\nmistaken. He estimated the prior odds of an accused person\u2019s guilt at 50\u201350\nand the probability that a juror was being truthful somewhat higher. Even at\nthat, if a jury of eight voted by simple majority, the chance that they judged\nthe accused\u2019s guilt wrong would be 65/256, or more than one in four. Thus\nfor both mathematical and religious reasons Laplace sided with the\nEnlightenment\u2019s most radical demand, the abolition of capital punishment:\n\u201cThe possibility of atoning for these errors is the strongest argument of\nphilosophers who have wanted to abolish the death penalty.\u201d19 Laplace also\nused his rule for more complicated cases where a court must decide among\ncontradictory witnesses or where the reliability of testimony decreases with", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2603, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ca8c4f7-e909-4955-afcf-45e7656c2615": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ca8c4f7-e909-4955-afcf-45e7656c2615", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a897fd8-363a-4cbf-82e2-c6597e1216c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "49b00f0e6be287443c5b44d5f625aa50ba609699d93f2997cf6d9381c561a982", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "each telling. For Laplace, these questions demonstrated that ancient biblical\naccounts by the Apostles lacked credibility.\nWhile still counting babies, Laplace returned to study the seeming instability\nof Saturn and Jupiter\u2019s orbits, the problem that had helped sensitize him early\nin his career to uncertain data. He did not, however, use his new knowledge\nof probability to solve this important problem. He used other methods\nbetween 1785 and 1788 to determine that Jupiter and Saturn oscillate gently\nin an 877-year cycle around the sun and that the moon orbits Earth in a cycle\nmillions of years long. The orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, and the moon were not\nexceptions to Newton\u2019s gravitation but thrilling examples of it. The solar\nsystem was in equilibrium, and the world would not end. This discovery was\nthe biggest advance in physical astronomy since Newton\u2019s law of gravity.\nDespite Laplace\u2019s astounding productivity, his life as a professional scientist\nwas financially precarious. Fortunately, Paris in the 1700s had more\neducational institutions and scientific opportunities than anywhere else on\nEarth, and academy members could patch jobs together to make a respectable\nliving. Laplace tripled his income by examining artillery and naval\nengineering students three or four months a year and serving as a scientist in\nthe Duke of Orleans\u2019 entourage. His increasingly secure position also gave\nhim access to the government statistics he needed to develop and test his\nprobability of causes.\nAt the age of 39, with a bright future ahead of him, Laplace married 18-\nyear-old Marie Anne Charlotte Courty de Romange. The average age of\nmarriage for French women was 27, but Marie Anne came from a prosperous\nand recently ennobled family with multiple ties to his financial and social\ncircle. A small street off the Boulevard Saint-Germain is named Courty for\nher family. The Laplaces would have two children; contraception, whether\ncoitus interruptus or pessaries, was common, and the church itself\ncampaigned against multiple childbirths because they endangered the lives of\nmothers. Some 16 months after the wedding a Parisian mob stormed the\nBastille, and the French Revolution began.\nAfter the revolutionary government was attacked by foreign monarchies,\nFrance spent a decade at war.

Condorcet,\ntrying to escape from Paris, died in jail.\nThe Revolution, however, transformed science from a popular hobby into\na full-fledged profession.

For almost 50 years\u2014from the\n1780s until his death in 1827\u2014France led world science as no other country\nhas before or since.

In\n1810 he announced the central limit theorem, one of the great scientific and\nstatistical discoveries of all time. It asserts that, with some exceptions, any\naverage of a large number of similar terms will have a normal, bell-shaped\ndistribution. Suddenly, the easy-to-use bell curve was a real mathematical\nconstruct.

The probability of causes was still useful in particularly uncertain\ncases because it was more powerful than frequentism. But science matured\nduring Laplace\u2019s lifetime.

He referred to it fondly as his\nsource of large numbers and the inspiration behind his development and use\nof generating functions.\nAnd finally, in the climax of one small part of his career, he proved the\nelegant, general version of his theorem that we now call Bayes\u2019 rule. He had\nintuited its principle as a young man in 1774. In 1781 he found a way to use\nBayes\u2019 two-step process to derive the formula by making certain restrictive\nassumptions.

In a sense,\neverything is Laplacean.\u201d23\nIf advancing the world\u2019s knowledge is important, Bayes\u2019 rule should be\ncalled Laplace\u2019s rule or, in modern parlance, BPL for Bayes-Price-Laplace.\nSadly, a half century of usage forces us to give Bayes\u2019 name to what was\nreally Laplace\u2019s achievement.\nSince discovering his first version of Bayes\u2019 rule in 1774, Laplace had\nused it primarily to develop new mathematical techniques and had applied it\nmost extensively to the social sciences, that is, demography and judicial\nreform. Not until 1815, at the age of 66, did he apply it to his first love,\nastronomy. He had received some astonishingly accurate tables compiled by\nhis assistant Alexis Bouvard, the director of the Paris Observatory. Using\nLaplace\u2019s probability of causes, Bouvard had calculated a large number of\nobservations about the masses of Jupiter and Saturn, estimated the possible\nerror for each entry, and then predicted the probable masses of the planets.\nLaplace was so delighted with the tables that, despite his aversion to\ngambling, he used Bayes\u2019 rule to place a famous bet with his readers: odds\nwere 11,000 to 1 that Bouvard\u2019s results for Saturn were off by less than 1%.\nFor Jupiter, the odds were a million to one. Space-age technology confirms\nthat Laplace and Bouvard should have won both bets.\nLate in his career, Laplace also applied his probability of causes to a\nvariety of calculations in Earth science, notably to the tides and to changes in\nbarometric pressure. He used a nonnumerical common-sense version of his\nprobability of causes to advance his famous nebular hypothesis: that the\nplanets and their satellites in our solar system originated in a swirl of dust.\nAnd he compared three hypotheses about the orbits of 100 comets to confirm", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2581, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc0a7018-ef2c-4d8e-b332-5a91d8cf8608": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc0a7018-ef2c-4d8e-b332-5a91d8cf8608", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d539342-e326-4b25-81c9-684e510122ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "94e442733572da9981af1af9f88f64a65a3c9dd559f10f0bb32659736cf7a7b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "what he already knew: that the comets most probably originate within the\nsun\u2019s sphere of influence.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, France\u2019s new king, Louis XVIII, bestowed the\nhereditary title of marquis on Laplace, the son of a village innkeeper.

He had brought modern\nscience to students, governments, and the reading public and had developed\nprobability into a formidable method for handling unknown and complex\ncauses of natural phenomena. And in one small, relatively insignificant\nportion of his lifework he became the first to express and use what is now\ncalled Bayes\u2019 rule.

The English mathematician\nAugustus de Morgan wrote in The Penny Cyclopaedia of 1839 that Laplace\nfailed to credit the work of others; the accusation was repeated without\nsubstantiation for 150 years until a detailed study by Stigler concluded it was\ngroundless.

The statistician Karl Pearson, no\nshrinking violet, called the author of the Britannica article \u201cone of the most\nsuperficial writers that ever obscured the history of science. . . . Such\nstatements published by a writer of one nation about one of the most\ndistinguished men of a second nation, and wholly unsubstantiated by\nreferences, are in every way deplorable.\u201d5 Modern historians have shown\nthat many of the disparaging comments about Laplace\u2019s life and work were\nfalse.\nPersonal insults aside, Laplace launched a craze for statistics that would\nultimately inundate both Bayes\u2019 original rule and Laplace\u2019s own version of\nit. He did so by publicizing in 1827 the then-extraordinary fact that the\nnumber of dead letters in the Parisian postal system remained roughly\nconstant from year to year. After the French government published a\nlandmark series of statistics about the Paris region, it appeared that many\nirrational and godless criminal activities, including thefts, murders, and\nsuicides, were also constants. By 1830 stable statistical ratios were firmly\ndissociated from divine providence, and Europe was swept by a veritable\nmania for the objective numbers needed by good government.\nUnsettled by rapid urbanization, industrialization, and the rise of a market\neconomy, early Victorians formed private statistical societies to study filth,\ncriminality, and numbers. The chest sizes of Scottish soldiers, the number of\nPrussian officers killed by kicking horses, the incidence of cholera victims\u2014\nstatistics were easy to collect. Even women could do it. No mathematical\nanalysis was necessary or expected. That most of the government bureaucrats\ncollecting statistics were ignorant of and even hostile to mathematics did not\nmatter. Facts, pure facts, were the order of the day.\nGone was the idea that we can use probability to quantify our lack of\nknowledge.

The French Revolution and its\naftermath shattered the idea that all rational people share the same beliefs.\nThe Western world split between Romantics, who rejected science outright,\nand those who sought certainty in natural science and were enthralled by the\nobjectivity of numbers, whether the number of knifings or of marriages at a\nparticular age.\nDuring the decade after Laplace\u2019s death, four European revisionists led the\ncharge against Laplace and probability, the mathematics of uncertainty. John\nStuart Mill denounced probability as \u201can aberration of the intellect\u201d and\n\u201cignorance . . . coined into science.\u201d7 Objectivity became a virtue,\nsubjectivity an insult, and the probability of causes a target of skepticism, if\nnot hostility. Awash in newly collected data, the revisionists preferred to\njudge the probability of an event according to how frequently it occurred\namong many observations. Eventually, adherents of this frequency-based\nprobability became known as frequentists or sampling theorists.\nTo frequentists Laplace was such a towering target that Thomas Bayes\u2019\nexistence barely registered. When critics thought of Bayes\u2019 rule, they thought\nof it as Laplace\u2019s rule and focused their criticism on him and his followers.\nArguing that probabilities should be measured by objective frequencies of\nevents rather than by subjective degrees of belief, they treated the two\napproaches as opposites, although Laplace had considered them basically\nequivalent.\nThe reformers denounced Laplace\u2019s pragmatic simplifications as gross\nabuses. Two of his most popular applications of probability were\ncondemned wholesale. Laplace had asked: given that the sun has risen\nthousands of times in the past, will it rise tomorrow? and given that the\nplanets revolve in similar ways around the sun, is there a single cause of the\nsolar system? He did not actually use Bayes\u2019 rule for either project, only\nsimple gambling odds. Sometimes, though, he and his followers began\nanswering these questions by assuming 50\u201350 odds.

He warned his readers about it. His\nfollowers also sometimes weighted their initial odds heavily in favor of\nnatural laws and weakened counterexamples. Critics pounded away at the\nfact that chance was irrelevant to the questions at hand. They identified\nBayes\u2019 rule with equal priors and damned the entire rule because of them.\nFew of the critics tried to even imagine other kinds of priors.\nYears later John Maynard Keynes studied the complaints made about\nLaplace\u2019s assessment, based on 5,000 years of history, that \u201cit is a bet of\n1,825,214 to 1 that [the sun] will rise tomorrow.\u201d Summarizing the\narguments, Keynes wrote that Laplace\u2019s reasoning \u201chas been rejected by\n[George] Boole on the ground that the hypotheses on which it is based are\narbitrary, by [John] Venn on the ground that it does not accord with\nexperience, by [Joseph] Bertrand because it is ridiculous, and doubtless by\nothers also.

He had developed two theories\nof probability and shown that when large numbers are involved they lead to\nmore or less the same results. But if natural science was the route to certain\nknowledge, how could it be subjective? Soon scientists were treating the two\napproaches as diametric opposites. Lacking a definitive experiment to decide\nthe controversy and with Laplace demonstrating that both methods often lead\nto roughly the same result, the tiny world of probability experts would be\nhard put to settle the argument.\nResearch into probability mathematics petered out. Within two generations\nof his death Laplace was remembered largely for astronomy. By 1850 not a\nsingle copy of his massive treatise on probability was available in Parisian\nbookstores.

Laplace and Condorcet had expected social scientists to be\nthe biggest users of Bayes\u2019 rule, but they were reluctant to adopt any form of\nprobability. An American scientist and philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce\npromoted frequency-based probability during the late 1870s and early 1880s.\nIn 1891 a Scottish mathematician, George Chrystal, composed an obituary for\nLaplace\u2019s method: \u201cThe laws of . . . Inverse Probability being dead, they\nshould be decently buried out of sight, and not embalmed in text-books and\nexamination papers. . . . The indiscretions of great men should be quietly\nallowed to be forgotten.\u201d9\nFor the third time Bayes\u2019 rule was left for dead. The first time, Bayes\nhimself had shelved it. The second time, Price revived it briefly before it\nagain died of neglect. This time theoreticians buried it.\nThe funeral was a trifle premature. Despite Chrystal\u2019s condemnation,\nBayes\u2019 rule was still taught in textbooks and classrooms and used by\nastronomers because the anti-Bayesian frequentists had not yet produced a\nsystematic, practical substitute. In scattered niches far from the eyes of\ndisapproving theoreticians, Bayes bubbled along, helping real-life\npractitioners assess evidence, combine every possible form of information,\nand cope with the gaps and uncertainties in their knowledge.\nInto this breach between theoretical disapproval and practical utility\nmarched the French army, under the baton of a politically powerful\nmathematician named Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand. Bertrand reformed\nBayes for artillery field officers who dealt with a host of uncertainties: the\nenemy\u2019s precise location; air density; wind direction; variations among their\nhand-forged cannons; and the range, direction, and initial speed of\nprojectiles. In his widely used textbooks Bertrand preached that Laplace\u2019s\nprobability of causes was the only valid method for verifying a hypothesis\nwith new observations.

Alfred Dreyfus, a\nFrench Jew and army officer, was falsely convicted of spying for Germany\nand condemned to life imprisonment. Almost the only evidence against\nDreyfus was a letter he was accused of having sold to a German military\nattach\u00e9.

Bertillon\u2019s notions of probability were mathematical\ngibberish, and he developed ever more fantastical arguments.

Poincar\u00e9 believed in\nfrequency-based statistics. But when asked whether Bertillon\u2019s document\nwas written by Dreyfus or someone else, he invoked Bayes\u2019 rule.

Molina, whose family had emigrated from Portugal\nvia France, was born in New York in 1877. He graduated from a city high\nschool but, with no money for college, got a job first at Western Electric\nCompany and then at AT&T\u2019s engineering and research department (later\ncalled Bell Laboratories). The Bell System of phone companies was\nadopting a new mathematical approach to problem solving. Molina\u2019s boss,\nGeorge Ashley Campbell, had studied probability with Poincar\u00e9 in France\nbut other employees were learning it from the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\nMolina taught himself mathematics and physics and became the nation\u2019s\nleading expert on Bayesian and Laplacean probability.\nUnlike many others at the time, he realized that \u201cgreat confusion exists\nbecause many authorities have failed to distinguish clearly between the\noriginal Bayes inverse theorem and its subsequent generalization by Laplace.\nThe general theorem embraces, or brings together, both the data obtained\nfrom a series of observations and whatever \u2018collateral\u2019 information exists in\nrelation to the observed results.\u201d11 As Molina explained, applied statisticians\nwere often forced to make quick decisions based on meager observational\ndata; in such cases, they had to rely on indirect prior knowledge, called\ncollateral information. This could range from assessments of national or\nhistoric trends to an executive\u2019s mental health. Methods for utilizing both\nstatistical and nonstatistical types of evidence were needed.\nUsing Laplace\u2019s formula, Molina combined his prior information about the\neconomics of automating Bell telephone systems with data about telephone\ncall traffic, call length, and waiting time. The result was a cost-effective way\nfor Bell to deal with uncertainties in telephone usage.\nMolina then worked on automating Bell\u2019s labor-intensive system.

At the University of California in Berkeley he had taught\nprobability for future insurance professionals.

He understood something else too.

Thus a machine shop\u2019s premium could be based on data\nfrom other, similar businesses or, if it was large enough, its own experience.\nCombining data from related businesses concentrated the numbers, pulling\nthem closer to the mean and making them more accurate, a subtle \u201cshrinking\u201d\neffect that Charles Stein would explain in the 1950s. What remained was a\nstunningly simple formula that a clerk could compute, an underwriter could\nunderstand, and a salesman could explain to his customers.

There Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher\nwere developing statistics\u2014the mathematics of uncertainties\u2014into the first\ninformation science. Early in the twentieth century, as they created new ways\nto study biology and heredity, theoreticians would change their attitudes\ntoward Bayes\u2019 rule from tepid toleration to outright hostility.\nKarl Pearson (I repeat his first name because his son Egon figures in\nBayes\u2019 story too) was a zealous atheist, socialist, feminist, Darwinist,\nGermanophile, and eugenicist. To save the British Empire, he believed the\ngovernment should encourage the upper middle class to procreate and the\npoor to abstain. Karl Pearson ruled Britain\u2019s 30-odd statistical theorists for\nyears. In the process he introduced two generations of applied\nmathematicians to the kind of feuding and professional bullying generally\nseen only on middleschool playgrounds.\nContentious, unquenchably ambitious, and craggily determined, Karl\nPearson was ambivalent about few things, but Bayes\u2019 rule was one of them.\nUniform priors and subjectivity made him nervous. With few other tools\navailable to statisticians, however, he concluded sadly that \u201cthe practical\nman will . . . accept the results of inverse probability of the Bayes-Laplace\nbrand till better are forthcoming.\u201d22 As Keynes said in A Treatise on\nProbability in 1921, \u201cThere is still about it for scientists a smack of\nastrology, of alchemy.\u201d Four years later the American mathematician Julian\nL. Coolidge agreed: \u201cWe use Bayes\u2019 formula with a sigh, as the only thing\navailable under the circumstances.\u201d23\nAnother geneticist, Ronald Aylmer Fisher, eventually contested Karl\nPearson\u2019s statistical crown and dealt Bayes\u2019 rule a near-lethal blow. If\nBayes\u2019 story were a TV melodrama, it would need a clear-cut villain, and\nFisher would probably be the audience\u2019s choice by acclamation.\nHe didn\u2019t look the part.

A colleague,\nWilliam Kruskal, described Fisher\u2019s life as \u201ca sequence of scientific fights,\noften several at a time, at scientific meetings and in scientific papers.\u201d24 In a\nbasically sympathetic rendering of Fisher\u2019s career, the Bayesian theorist\nJimmie Savage said he \u201csometimes published insults that only a saint could\nentirely forgive. . . .

And in enormous measure,\nhe achieved all of that, though never enough to bring him peace.\u201d25 Part of\nFisher\u2019s frustration may have arisen from the fact that, on many statistical\nmatters, he was correct.\nFisher was 16 when the family business collapsed. At Cambridge on a\nscholarship, he became the top mathematics student in his class and, in 1911,\nthe founder and chair of the Cambridge University Eugenics Society. A few\nyears later he solved in one page a problem Karl Pearson had struggled over\nfor years; Pearson thought Fisher\u2019s solution was rubbish and refused to\npublish it in his prestigious journal Biometrika. The two continued to feud as\nlong as they lived. But in straightening out inconsistencies in Karl Pearson\u2019s\nwork, Fisher pioneered the first comprehensive and rigorous theory of\nstatistics and set it on its mathematical and anti-Bayesian course.\nThe enmity between these two volatile men is striking because both were\nfervent eugenicists who believed that the careful breeding of British\nsupermen and superwomen would improve the human population and the\nBritish Empire. To help support his wife and eight children on a subsistence\nfarm, Fisher accepted funds from a controversial source, Charles Darwin\u2019s\nson Leonard, who, as honorary president of the Eugenics Education Society,\nadvocated the detention of \u201cinferior types, . . . the sexes being kept apart\u201d to\nprevent them from bearing children.26 In return for his financial help, Fisher\npublished more than 200 reviews in Darwin\u2019s magazine between 1914 and\n1934.\nIn 1919, few jobs were available in statistics or eugenics but Fisher\nlanded a position analyzing fertilizers at Rothamsted Agricultural Experiment\nStation.

Fascinated, Fisher worked\nout better ways to design experiments.\nOver the years he pioneered randomization methods, sampling theory, tests\nof significance, maximum likelihood estimation, analysis of variance, and\nexperimental design methods. Thanks to Fisher, experimental scientists, who\nhad traditionally ignored statistical methods, learned to incorporate them\nwhen designing their projects. As the twentieth century\u2019s statistical\nmagistrate, Fisher often ended lengthy discussions with a one-word verdict:\n\u201cRandomize.\u201d In 1925 he published a revolutionary manual of new\ntechniques, Statistical Methods for Research Workers. A cookbook of\ningenious statistical procedures for nonstatisticians, it turned frequency into\nthe de facto statistical method. His first manual sold 20,000 copies, and a\nsecond went through seven editions before Fisher\u2019s death in 1962. His\nanalysis of variance, which tells how to separate the effects of various\ntreatments, has become one of the natural sciences\u2019 most important tools. His\nsignificance test and its p-values would be used millions of times even as,\nover the years, it became increasingly controversial. No one today can\ndiscuss statistics\u2014what he called \u201cmathematics applied to observational\ndata\u201d\u2014without using some of Fisher\u2019s vocabulary.28 Many of his ideas were\nsolutions to computational problems caused by the limitations of the era\u2019s\ndesk calculators. Soon statistical departments rang with the music of bells\nactivated by mechanical calculating machines at every step of their Fisherian\ncalculations.\nFisher himself became a superb geneticist who did mathematical statistics\non the side. He filled his house with cats, dogs, and thousands of mice for\ncross-breeding experiments; he could document each animal\u2019s pedigree for\ngenerations. Unlike Bayes, Price, and Laplace, he did not need to supplement\ninadequate or conflicting observations with hunches or subjective judgments.\nHis experiments produced small data sets and subsets tightly focused to\nanswer a single question with rigorous mathematics.

His constant readiness to quarrel made it hard for opponents to\nengage him. Bayesians were not alone in concluding that Fisher adopted\nsome of his positions \u201csimply to avoid agreeing with his opponents.\u201d35\nDriven by the need to deal with uncertainties and save time and money,\nfrequency-based sampling theorists enjoyed a golden age during the 1920s\nand 1930s. Fisher liberated scientists to summarize and draw conclusions\nwithout having to deal with Bayes\u2019 messy prior prejudices and hunches. And\nthanks to his insistence on mathematical rigor, statistics was becoming, if not\nquite \u201creal mathematics,\u201d at least a distinct mathematical discipline,\nmathematics as applied to data.\nThe feud between Karl Pearson and Fisher entered its second generation\nwhen Karl\u2019s son Egon became another victim of Fisher\u2019s wrath. Unlike his\nfather, Egon Pearson was a modest, even self-effacing gentleman. At first,\nlike his father and Fisher earlier in their careers, Egon Pearson frequently\nused Bayes\u2019 rule.

He concluded that more data had\nto be collected, but no one took up the challenge. Instead, Egon Pearson\nbusied himself trying to make Fisher\u2019s work more mathematically rigorous,\nthereby enraging both Fisher and his father.\nEgon Pearson and a Polish mathematician, Jerzy Neyman, teamed up in\n1933 to develop the Neyman-Pearson theory of hypothesis testing. Until then,\nstatisticians had tested one hypothesis at a time and either accepted or\nrejected it without considering alternatives. Egon Pearson\u2019s idea was that the\nonly correct reason for rejecting a statistical hypothesis was to accept a more\nprobable one. As he, Neyman, and Fisher developed it, the theory became\none of the twentieth century\u2019s most influential pieces of applied mathematics.\nEgon Pearson was afraid of contradicting his father, however. His \u201cfears of\nK.P. and R.A.F.\u201d precipitated a psychological crisis in 1925 and 1926: \u201cI\nhad to go through the painful stage of realizing that K.P. could be wrong . . .\nand I was torn between conflicting emotions: a. finding it difficult to\nunderstand R. A. F., b. hating him for his attacks on my paternal \u2018god,\u2019 c.\nrealizing that in some things at least he was right.\u201d36 To placate his father,\nEgon gave up the woman he loved; they married many years later.

Their views on testing, which could be an order\nof magnitude apart, formed the crux of their bitter fight. According to\nNeyman, though, the argument began because Fisher demanded that Neyman\nlecture only from Fisher\u2019s book. When Neyman refused, Fisher promised to\noppose him \u201cin all my capacities.\u201d\nIn an argument during a meeting of the Royal Society on March 28, 1934, a\nsecretary took the customary word-for-word notes for verbatim publication.\nNeyman presented a paper arguing that the Latin square (a technique invented\nby Fisher for experimental design) was biased.

The joke, of course, was that the University of Berkeley\u2019s\nnamesake, the Bishop Berkeley, had disapproved of calculus and\nmathematicians.\nThe golden age of probability theory had turned into a double-fronted\nattack by two camps of warring frequentists united in their abhorrence of\nBayes. In the maelstrom, the lack of reasoned discourse among the leaders of\nstatistical mathematics delayed the development of Bayes\u2019 rule for decades.\nCaught in the infighting, the rule was left to find its way alone, stymied and\ndisparaged.\nYet even as the frequentists\u2019 assault laid it low, the first glimmerings of a\nrevival flickered here and there, quietly and almost unnoticed. In a\nremarkable confluence of thinking, three men in three different countries\nindependently came up with the same idea about Bayes: knowledge is indeed\nhighly subjective, but we can quantify it with a bet. The amount we wager\nshows how much we believe in something.\nIn 1924 a French mathematician, \u00c9mile Borel, concluded that a person\u2019s\nsubjective degree of belief could be measured by the amount he was willing\nto bet. Borel argued that applying probability to real problems, such as\ninsurance, biology, agriculture, and physics, was far more important than\nmathematical theorizing. He believed in rational behavior and lived as he\ntaught.

Ramsey made the same suggestion. Before he\ndied at the age of 26 following surgeries for jaundice, he wondered how we\nshould make decisions in the face of uncertainty. In an informal talk to\nstudents at the Moral Sciences Club at Cambridge University in 1926\nRamsey suggested that probability was based on personal beliefs that could\nbe quantified by a wager. Such extreme subjectivity broke radically with\nprevious thinkers like Mill, who had denounced subjective probabilities as\nthe abhorrent quantification of ignorance.\nRamsey, who in his brief career also contributed to economics, logic, and\nphilosophy, believed uncertainty had to be described in terms of probability\nrather than by tests and procedures. By talking about a measure of belief as a\nbasis for action and by introducing a utility function and the maximization of\nexpected utility, he showed how to act in the face of uncertainty. Neither\nBayes nor Laplace had ventured into the world of decisions and behavior.\nBecause Ramsey worked in Cambridge, England, the history of Bayes\u2019 rule\nmight have been quite different had he lived longer.\nAt almost the same time as Borel and Ramsey, an Italian actuary and\nmathematics professor, Bruno de Finetti, also suggested that subjective\nbeliefs could be quantified at the racetrack.

He had no precise exposure\nrecords, however, and the effects of low doses were not understood. Reed\nnormally used frequency methods and repeated tests on fruit flies, protozoa,\nand bacteria; but to ascertain doses for humans he would have to use\nexpensive mammals. With Bayes, he determined the most therapeutic doses\nfor human cancer patients by sacrificing a relatively small number of cats,\n27. But Reed worked outside the statistical mainstream, used Bayes only\noccasionally, and had little influence on statistics. Even Ramsey, Borel, de\nFinetti, and Essen-M\u00f6ller had to wait decades before the importance of their\nwork was recognized.\nIt was a geophysicist, Harold Jeffreys, who almost singlehandedly kept\nBayes alive during the anti-Bayesian onslaught of the 1930s and 1940s.\nCambridge University students liked to joke that they had the world\u2019s two\ngreatest statisticians, although one was a professor of astronomy and the\nother a professor of genetics.

They differed, however,\nwhen small amounts of data were involved. Years later others would\ndramatize situations where Jeffreys\u2019s and Fisher\u2019s significance test results\ncan differ by an order of magnitude.\nAside from their views on Bayes, Jeffreys and Fisher had much in\ncommon. Both were practicing scientists who manipulated statistical data;\nneither was a mathematician or statistician. Both were educated at\nCambridge; Jeffreys, in fact, never left and was a fellow there for 75 years,\nlonger than any other professor.

Both\nwere knighted for their work.\nOf the two, Jeffreys led the richer personal life. At the age of 49 he\nmarried his longtime collaborator, the mathematician Bertha Swirles; they\nproofread their monumental Methods of Mathematical Physics during all-\nnight stints as air raid wardens during the Second World War. He enjoyed\nannotating discrepancies in detective novels, singing tenor in choral\nsocieties, botanizing, walking, traveling, and, until he was 91, bicycling to\nwork.\nLike Laplace, Jeffreys studied the formation of the Earth and planets in\norder to understand the origin of the solar system. He became involved in\nstatistics because he was interested in how earthquake waves travel through\nthe Earth. A major earthquake generates seismic waves that can be recorded\nthousands of miles away. By measuring their arrival times at different\nstations, Jeffreys could work back to determine the earthquake\u2019s likely\nepicenter and the likely composition of the Earth. It was a classic problem in\nthe inverse probability of causes. In 1926 Jeffreys inferred that Earth\u2019s\ncentral core is liquid\u2014probably molten iron, probably mixed with traces of\nnickel.\nAs one historian said, \u201cPerhaps in no other field were as many remarkable\ninferences drawn from so ambiguous and indirect data.\u201d46 Signals were often\ndifficult to interpret, and seismograph machines differed greatly.\nEarthquakes, which often occurred far apart under very different conditions,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2495, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0b22f4e-3dce-4c12-8e48-fba4db83bba1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0b22f4e-3dce-4c12-8e48-fba4db83bba1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8514fe1-a1ee-428c-823d-e74b7322176f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "97de8f9f4710c4ff2c58da93fb86f6ecf1395d2bf37119f2909147d9f54eac68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "were hardly repeatable.

As he put it, \u201cInstead of trying to see whether there was\nany more satisfactory form of the prior probability, a succession of authors\nhave said that the prior probability is nonsense and therefore that the\nprinciple of inverse probability, which cannot work without [priors], is\nnonsense too.\u201d48\nJeffreys considered probability appropriate for all uncertainty, even\nsomething as apparently certain as a scientific law, whereas frequentists\nusually restricted probability to the uncertainties associated with\ntheoretically repeatable data. As the statistician Dennis Lindley wrote,\nJeffreys \u201cwould admit a probability for the existence of the greenhouse\neffect, whereas most [frequentist] statisticians would not and would confine\ntheir probabilities to the data on CO2, ozone, heights of the oceans, etc.\u201d49\nJeffreys was particularly annoyed by Fisher\u2019s measures of uncertainty, his\n\u201cp-values\u201d and significance levels.

The difference was that Fisher used the word \u201cBayes\u201d as an insult,\nwhile Jeffreys called it the Pythagorean theorem of probability theory. As the\nfirst since Laplace to apply formal Bayesian theory to a variety of important\nscientific problems, Jeffreys became the founder of modern Bayesian\nstatistics.\nStatistically, the lines were drawn. Jeffreys and Fisher, two otherwise\ncordial Cambridge professors, embarked on a two-year debate in the Royal\nSociety\u2019s Proceedings. Jeffreys may have been shy and uncommunicative,\nbut when he was sure of himself he dug in, placidly but implacably. Fisher\nremained his usual \u201cvolcanic and paranoid\u201d self.54 Both men were\nmagnificent scientists, the world\u2019s leading statisticians, and each used the\nmethods best suited to his respective field.

Like gladiators of old, they hurled impassioned articles back\nand forth, criticizing one another and issuing formal rejoinders, probing\nrebuttals, and brilliant clarifications\u2014until Royal Society editors threw up\ntheir hands in exasperation and ordered the warriors to cease and desist.\nAfter the grand debate, Jeffreys wrote a monumental book, Theory of\nProbability, which remained for years the only systematic explanation of\nhow to apply Bayes to scientific problems. Fisher complained publicly that\nJeffreys makes \u201ca logical mistake on the first page which invalidates all the\n395 formulae in his book.\u201d55 The mistake, of course, was to use Bayes\u2019\ntheorem. Summarizing Jeffreys\u2019s books, Lindley said, \u201cDe Finetti is a master\nof theory, Fisher a master of practice, but Jeffreys is brilliant at both.\u201d56\nThe Fisher\u2013Jeffreys debate ended inconclusively.

To him,\ndecision making\u2014so important for the rise of mathematical statistics during\nthe Second World War and the Cold War\u2014was irrelevant. Others parted at\nthe same divide: a big reason for the feud between Fisher and Neyman, for\nexample, was decision theory.\nAll these factors left Jeffreys almost totally isolated from statistical\ntheorists.

Jeffreys knew Ramsey and visited him as he was dying in the\nhospital, but neither realized the other was working on probability theory; in\nany case, Jeffreys was interested in scientific inference and Ramsey in\ndecision making.

Although\nthe British desperately needed to know where the U-boats were, the\nmessages were unreadable. They had been encrypted by word-scrambling\nmachines, and no one in Germany or Britain thought their codes could be\nbroken.\nStrangely enough, the Poles were the first to think otherwise. A few\nintelligence officers in Poland, sandwiched as they were between Germany\nand Russia, realized a full decade before the start of the Second World War\nthat mathematics could make eavesdropping on their rapacious neighbors\nquite informative. The First World War had made the need for machines to\nencode radio messages painfully obvious. When an alphabet-scrambling\nmachine was exhibited at an international trade show in 1923, Germany\nbought some and began introducing complexities to make their codes more\nsecure. The machines were named Enigma.\nAnd enigmas they were. The Poles spent three years trying unsuccessfully\nto crack German messages before realizing that automated cipher machines\nhad transformed cryptography. The science of coding and decoding secret\nmessages had become a game for mathematicians. When the Polish secret\nservice organized a top-secret cryptography class for German-speaking\nmathematics students, its star pupil was an actuarial mathematician named\nMari\u00e1n Rejewski. He used inspired guesswork and group theory\u2014the new\nmathematics of transformation\u2014to make a crucial discovery: how the wheels\non an Enigma were wired. By early 1938 the Poles were reading 75% of\nGermany\u2019s army and air force messages. Shortly before their country was\ninvaded in 1939 they invited French and British agents to a safehouse in the\nPyry Forest outside Warsaw, revealed their system, and sent an updated\nEnigma machine to London.\nTo an observer, an Enigma looked rather like a complicated typewriter,\nwith a traditional keyboard of 26 letter keys and a second array of 26 lettered\nlights. Each time a typist pressed a letter key, an electric current passed\nthrough a set of three wheels and advanced one of them a notch.

He had also\ndeveloped an almost unique set of interests: the abstract mathematics of\ntopology and logic; the applied mathematics of probability; the experimental\nderivation of fundamental principles; the construction of machines that could\nthink; and codes and ciphers. Turing had already spent hours in the United\nStates discussing cryptography in his high-pitched stammer with a Canadian\nphysicist named Malcolm MacPhail.\nAfter Turing returned to England in the spring of 1939, his name was\nquietly added to a short \u201cemergency list\u201d of people with orders to report\nimmediately to the GC&CS in the event war was declared.

Good thought \u201cthe game of\nBanburismus was enjoyable, not easy enough to be trivial, but not difficult\nenough to cause a nervous breakdown.\u201d16 Bayes\u2019 rule was proving to be a\nnatural for cryptography, good for hedging bets when there were prior\nguesses and decisions to be made with a minimum of time or cost.\nTuring was developing a homegrown Bayesian system. Finding the Enigma\nsettings that had encoded a particular message was a classic problem in the\ninverse probability of causes. No one is sure where Turing picked Bayes up,\nwhether he rediscovered it independently or adapted it from something\noverheard about Jeffreys, Cambridge\u2019s lone defender of Bayes\u2019 rule before\nthe war. All we know for sure is that, because Turing and Good had studied\npure mathematics and not statistics, neither had been sufficiently poisoned by\nanti-Bayesian attitudes.\nIn any event, Turing talked at Bletchley Park about bans, not Bayes.\nOnce Good asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you essentially using Bayes\u2019 theorem?\u201d17\nTuring answered, \u201cI suppose.\u201d Good concluded that Turing knew of the\ntheorem\u2019s existence.

Barnard, one day in London and\u2014strictly\nagainst the rules\u2014\u201ctold him that we were using Bayes factors, and their\nlogarithms, sequentially, to discriminate between two hypotheses but of\ncourse I did not mention the application.

In\nsequential analysis, once several tests or observations strongly cleared or\ncondemned a case of, say, field rations or machine-gun ammunition, the tester\ncould move on to the next box. This almost halved the number of tests\nrequired, and the use of logarithms massively simplified calculations by\nsubstituting addition for multiplication.

He had\nboth the theory and the method for breaking Enigma codes but still could not\nread U-boat messages. The Germans were building more U-boats, and Adm.\nKarl Doenitz had formed wolf packs of subs strung across the North Atlantic;\nwhen one U-boat spotted a convoy, it radioed the rest. During the first 40\nmonths of the war, U-boats sank 2,177 merchant ships totaling more than 1\nmillion tons, far more than were lost to German aircraft, mines, warships,\nand other causes.\nIf the British were going to be able to route supply convoys around the U-\nboats, Turing needed more information. He needed to see one of the code-\nbooks that U-boat Enigma operators used before broadcasting a ciphered\nmessage. One of the factors that made breaking the Enigma code so difficult\nwas that the operator doubly-enciphered a trio of letters that began each\nmessage and that indicated the starting positions of the Enigma\u2019s three\nwheels. The operator enciphered the three letters twice over: once\nmechanically, with his Enigma machine, and once manually, by selecting one\nof nine sets of tables in a codebook issued to each sub. The operator learned\nwhich table to use each day by consulting a calendar issued with the tables. If\na U-boat came under attack, crews had strict orders to destroy the tables\neither before abandoning ship or as the enemy was about to board.\nIn a brilliant piece of deduction shortly after war was declared, Turing\nfigured out this double-encipherment system, but he needed a copy of the\ncodebook to make Banburismus work. Enigmas had so many variations that\ntrial-and-error methods were ineffective. A codebook had to be \u201cpinched,\u201d\nas Turing put it.

Supplying Great Britain immediately became\nmore difficult. When American ships that had protected the convoys\nsupplying Britain were quickly transferred to the Pacific, 15 German U-boats\ntook their places in the shipping lanes off the American East Coast. As\nconvoys of Argentine beef and Caribbean oil hugged the coast, they were\nsilhouetted at night against shore lights that local communities dependent on\ntourism refused to dim. Miami\u2019s neon signs, for example, stretched for six\ndeadly miles. The U-boats, lying in wait at periscope depth, caused three\nmonths of devastation until the U.S. military ordered coastal lights turned off\nat dusk.\nMaking matters worse, the Atlantic U-boats added a fourth wheel to their\nEnigmas, and the Turing-Welchman bombes were stymied. For most of 1942\nTuring and his coworkers could not read any message to or from German\nsubmarines. Bletchley Park called it the Great Blackout. For four months the\nU-boats ran riot in the Atlantic at large, sinking 43 ships in August and\nSeptember alone. The average U.S. vessel crossed the Atlantic and back\nthree times before it was sunk on its fourth trip.\nFinally, in December 1942, three young British crewmen, Lt. Anthony\nFasson, Able-Seaman Colin Grazier, and Tommy Brown, swam from their\nship to a sinking German submarine off Egypt to pinch its vital codebook of\nencrypting tables. Fasson and Grazier drowned in the attempt, but Brown, a\n16-year-old canteen assistant, survived to rescue the tables. At last\nBanburismus was fully operational. Within hours of Bletchley Park\u2019s\nreceiving the tables, U-boat messages from the Atlantic were being\ndecrypted and convoys rerouted.\nThe month before that happened, however, would be the war\u2019s most\ndangerous month for Allied shipping, and during it Turing sailed for the\nUnited States on the Queen Elizabeth, a fast ship that traveled without\nconvoy.

Surprisingly, the British planned\nhis trip rather haphazardly. He arrived with inadequate identification, and\nU.S. immigration authorities almost confined him to Ellis Island. In addition,\nhe had not been told whether he could discuss Tunny code breaking with\nAmericans, and the Americans did not realize he expected to have full access\nto their voice-scrambling research. Nevertheless, during his stay he held\nhigh-level meetings in Dayton, Ohio, Washington, and New York City.\nTuring spent at least one afternoon in Dayton, where the National Cash\nRegister Company planned to manufacture 336 bombes. He was dismayed to\ndiscover that the U.S. Navy was ignoring Banburismus and its ability to\neconomize on bombe usage. The Americans seemed uninterested in the\nEnigma outside of their obligation to supply bombes for it.\nIn Washington, Turing discussed Bletchley Park\u2019s methods and bombes\nwith U.S. Navy cryptographers.

Then he added data\nthat were as objective as possible, as Jeffreys advised. Unlike Turing,\nKoopman had access to enormous amounts of detailed information that the\nmilitary had accumulated about U-boat warfare.\nUnfortunately, a U-boat could spot a destroyer long before the destroyer\u2019s\nsonar picked up the U-boat. Many U.S. planes were not equipped with\nwindshield wipers, and crews peered through scratched and soiled\nwindows. \u201cThe need for keeping the windows clean and clear cannot be\noveremphasized,\u201d Koopman admonished. If a crew was lucky enough to get\nbinoculars, they were standard navy 7 x 50 issue, hazy at best. Unless crew\nmembers changed stations frequently to minimize the monotony, they lost\nfocus.

The effort needed for each\nsubsection of the search area equaled the logarithm of the probability at that\npoint. The regions to be searched did not have to be boxes or circles; they\ncould have squiggly, irregular shapes. But using his formulas, he could tell a\ncommander how many hours of search to devote to each squiggly region.\nUsing Koopman\u2019s cookbook, a shipboard officer could lay out the optimal\nway to search given his limited resources: the expected time needed to find\nthe target; the boundaries beyond which he should not venture; and what he\nshould do every two hours until either the U-boat was found or the search\nwas called off. He could plan an eight-hour day, starting off with an optimum\nsearch for the first four hours; then, if a U-boat had not been found, the\ncommander could use Bayes\u2019 rule to update the target\u2019s probable location\nand launch a new plan every two hours to maximize his chance of locating it.\nAll of the commander\u2019s planning for two-hour sequential searches could\nbe done ahead of time in his stateroom. Koopman called it a \u201ccontinuous\ndistribution of effort.\u201d His U-boat sea searches were theoretically similar to\nKolmogorov\u2019s artillery problem. Koopman was searching for an unknown U-\nboat and needed to spread the search effort over an area in an optimal way,\njust as Kolmogorov figured the optimal amount of dispersion in order to\ndestroy a German cannon.

Later, Turing became interested in physical chemistry and\nhow huge biological molecules construct themselves into symmetrical\nshapes.\nA series of spectacular international events in 1949 and 1950 intruded on\nthese productive years and precipitated a personal crisis for Turing: the\nSoviets surprised the West by detonating an atomic bomb; Communists\ngained control of mainland China; Alger Hiss, Klaus Fuchs, and Julius and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2483, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c22d8567-839e-4db8-b410-078033a78756": {"__data__": {"id_": "c22d8567-839e-4db8-b410-078033a78756", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e02607e-a927-4edd-927d-a34a17734cb5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "0763a914461d36f7352413d91d238031fe90ce3c93527bdf9404014fb77b5ac0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Ethel Rosenberg were arrested for spying; and Sen.

With both the British and\nAmerican governments panicked by visions of a homosexual spy scandal, the\nnumber of men arrested for homosexuality in Britain spiked.\nOn the first day of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s reign, February 7, 1952, Turing\nwas arrested for homosexual activity conducted in the privacy of his home\nwith a consenting adult.

Less\nthan a decade after England fought a war against Nazis who had conducted\nmedical experiments on their prisoners, an English judge forced Turing to\nchoose between prison and chemical castration. He chose the estrogen\ninjections. Over the next year he grew breasts. And on June 7, 1954, the day\nafter the tenth anniversary of the Normandy invasion he helped make\npossible, Alan Turing committed suicide.

He worked alone, isolated from academic\nthinkers and from his actuarial colleagues, who scratched their heads at\nBailey\u2019s brilliance.\nAfter the war, in 1947, Bailey moved to the New York State Insurance\nDepartment as the regulatory agency\u2019s chief actuary. An insurance executive\ncalled him \u201cthe keeper of our consciences.\u201d As his colleagues boozed in\nhotel bars at conferences, Bailey sipped soft drinks and quoted occasionally\nfrom the Bible. During slack times, he read it. Some actuaries said \u201call\nmanner of nasty things about Arthur Bailey,\u201d the executive continued, \u201cbut we\nlearned to respect his integrity and stature from knowing him in the after-\nhours.\u201d7\nBailey began writing an article summarizing his tumultuous change in\nattitude toward Bayes\u2019 rule. Although his old-fashioned notation was\ndifficult to understand, he was building a mathematical foundation to justify\nthe use of current rates as the priors in Bayes\u2019 theorem. He started his paper\nwith a biblical justification for using prior beliefs: \u201cIf thou canst believe,\u201d he\nwrote, quoting the apostle Mark, \u201call things are possible to him that\nbelieveth.\u201d Then, reviewing Albert Whitney\u2019s mathematics for workers\u2019\ncompensation, Bailey affirmed the Bayesian roots of the Credibility theory\ndeveloped for workers\u2019 compensation insurance years before. Credibility\nwas central to actuarial thought, and while relative frequencies were\nrelevant, so were other kinds of information. Bailey worked out\nmathematical methods for melding every scrap of available information into\nthe initial body of data. He particularly tried to understand how to assign\npartial weights to supplementary evidence according to its credibility, that is,\nits subjective believability. His mathematical techniques would help\nactuaries systematically and consistently integrate thousands of old and new\nrates for different kinds of employers, activities, and locales. His working\nlibrary included a 1940 reprint of Bayes\u2019 articles with a preface by Bell\nTelephone\u2019s Edward Molina. Like Molina, Bailey used Laplace\u2019s more\ncomplex and precise system instead of Thomas Bayes\u2019.\nBy 1950 Bailey was a vice president of the Kemper Insurance Group in\nChicago and a frequent after-dinner speaker at black-tie banquets of the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2564, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db0439da-847b-4f67-8a95-e7ca6bbdc727": {"__data__": {"id_": "db0439da-847b-4f67-8a95-e7ca6bbdc727", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94578ba9-f962-4e03-86fb-7e1a71c529dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "078b89efb9fd2f78896f4b6a437489db3e29a3dd13b6793ec3120df0709335e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Casualty Actuarial Society.

First, he praised his colleagues for standing almost alone against the\nstatistical establishment and for staging the only organized revolt against the\nfrequentists\u2019 sampling philosophy. Insurance statisticians marched \u201ca step\nahead\u201d of others.

They have made this demonstration\nmany times. It does work!\u201d8\nThen he announced the startling news that their beloved Credibility\nformula was derived from Bayes\u2019 theorem. Practical actuaries had thought of\nBayes as an abstract, temporal solution treating time sequences of priors and\nposteriors. But Bailey reminded his colleagues that Bayes\u2019 friend and editor,\nRichard Price, would be considered today an actuary. And he turned Bayes\u2019\nimaginary table into a frontal attack on frequentists and the contentious\nFisher. He concluded with a rousing call to reinstate prior knowledge in\nstatistical theory. His challenge would occupy academic theorists for years.\nIt was a fighting speech. Reading it later, Professor Richard von Mises of\nHarvard praised it wholeheartedly. Von Mises wrote Bailey that he hoped his\nspeech would make \u201cthe unjustified and unreasonable attacks on the Bayes\ntheory, initiated by R. A. Fisher, fade out.\u201d9\nUnfortunately, Bailey did not live long to campaign for Bayes\u2019 rule. Four\nyears after giving his most important speech, he suffered a heart attack at the\nage of 49 and died on August 12, 1954. His son blamed the fact that Bailey\nhad started smoking in college and been unable to stop.\nStill, a few practicing actuaries understood his message.

Within a year more Americans\nwould be traveling by air than by railroad. Meanwhile, some statisticians\nwere wondering if they could avoid using the ever-controversial subjective\npriors by making predictions based on no prior information at all.\nLongley-Cook spent the holidays mulling over the problem, and on January\n6, 1955, he sent the CEO a prescient warning. Despite the industry\u2019s safety\nrecord, the available data on airline accidents in general made him expect\n\u201canything from 0 to 4 air carrier-to-air carrier collisions over the next ten\nyears.\u201d In short, the company should prepare for a costly catastrophe by\nraising premium rates for air carriers and purchasing reinsurance. Two years\nlater his prediction proved correct. A DC-7 and a Constellation collided\nover the Grand Canyon, killing 128 people in what was then commercial\naviation\u2019s worst accident. Four years after that, a DC-8 jet and a\nConstellation collided over New York City, killing 133 people in the planes\nand in the apartments below.10\nLater, Arthur Bailey\u2019s son, Robert A. Bailey, used Bayesian techniques to\njustify offering merit rates to good drivers. Motor vehicle casualty rates\nsoared so high during the 1960s that half the Americans then alive could\nexpect to be injured in a car accident during their lifetimes. Americans were\nbuying more cars and driving more miles, but laws had not kept pace. There\nwas no uniform road signage; most drivers and vehicles were tested or\ninspected only once in their lifetimes, if at all; penalties for drunk driving\nwere light; and cars were designed without safety in mind. Insurers suffered\nheavy losses. A direct, up-front system to reward good drivers was needed,\nbut merit rating was regarded as unsound because a single car had inadequate\ncredibility. Using Bayes\u2019 rule, Robert Bailey and Leroy J. Simon showed that\nrelevant data from Canada\u2019s safe-driving discounts could be used to update\nexisting U.S. statistics.\nRobert Bailey also used Bayesian procedures to rate insurance companies\nthemselves by incorporating nonstatistical, subjective information such as\nopinions about a company\u2019s ownership, including the quality and drinking\nhabits of its managers.

The joke was that if you didn\u2019t like the result of your\nfrequentist analysis, you just redid it using a different test. By comparison,\nBayes\u2019 rule seemed to have an overall rationale. As the number of\nstatisticians, symposia, articles, and journals multiplied, a series of\npublications issued around 1950 began to attract attention to the heretofore\ninvisible world of Bayes\u2019 rule.\nBayes stood poised for another of its periodic rebirths as three\nmathematicians, Jack Good, Leonard Jimmie Savage, and Dennis V. Lindley,\ntackled the job of turning Bayes\u2019 rule into a respectable form of mathematics\nand a logical, coherent methodology. The first publication heralding the\nBayesian revival was a book by Good, Alan Turing\u2019s wartime assistant. As\nGood explained, \u201cAfter the war, he [Turing] didn\u2019t have time to write about\nstatistics because he was too busy designing computers and computer\nlanguages, and speculating about artificial intelligence and the chemical\nbasis of morphogenesis, so with his permission, I developed his idea . . . in\nconsiderable detail.\u201d8 Good finished the first draft of Probability and the\nWeighing of Evidence in 1946 but could not get it published until 1950, the\nsame year Arthur Bailey issued his Bayesian manifesto for actuaries. Much\nof the delay, Good explained, was caused by the continuation of wartime\nsecrecy during the Cold War.\nAt first, his book fell on deaf ears. He was unaccustomed to teaching or\nexplaining his ideas, and no one knew he had used Bayes to help break the\nEnigma codes.

When David Kahn\u2019s bestseller The Codebreakers was\npublished in 1967, the National Security Agency censored a passage\nidentifying Good as one of Britain\u2019s top three cryptanalysts. He was at the\ntime one of the world\u2019s most knowledgeable people about the coding\nindustry. Good was quick, smart, original, armed with a fabulous memory,\nand unconventional enough to think about the paranormal and astrology and to\njoin Mensa, the organization for people with high IQs.

To reveal an ultraclassified\ntechnique used by Turing to find pairs and triplets of letters indicating the\nGerman submariners\u2019 code of the day, Good wrote about a favorite British\nhobby, bird watching. What if, he suggested, an avid bird watcher spotted\n180 different bird species? Many of them would be represented by only one\nbird; logically, the bird watcher must have entirely missed many other\nspecies. Counting those missing species as zero (as a frequentist would have\ndone) has the deleterious effect of asserting that missing species can never be\nfound. Turing decided to assign those missing species a tiny possibility, a\nprobability that is not zero. He was trying to learn about rare letter groupings\nthat did not appear in his collection of intercepted German messages. By\nestimating the frequency of missing species in his sample, he could use Bayes\nto estimate the probability of those letter groupings appearing in a much\nlarger sample of messages and in the very next Enigma message he received.\nDecades later, DNA decoders and artificial intelligence analysts would\nadopt the same technique.\nClever as he was, Good could be difficult to get along with, and he moved\nfrom post to post.

After the war he moved to the University\nof Chicago, a center of scientific excitement, thanks in large part to the\ndazzling Nobel Prize winner Enrico Fermi, the last physicist to excel at both\nexperimentation and theory. Fermi himself used Bayes. In the autumn of 1953,\nwhen Jay Orear, one of Fermi\u2019s graduate students, was struggling with a\nproblem involving three unknown quantities, Fermi told him to use a simple\nanalytic method that he called Bayes\u2019 theorem and that he had derived from\nC. F. Gauss. A year later, when Fermi died at the age of 53, Bayes\u2019 rule lost\na stellar supporter in the physical sciences.\nFermi was not the only important physicist to use Bayesian methods during\nthis period. A few years later, at Cornell University, Richard Feynman\nsuggested using Bayes\u2019 rule to compare contending theories in physics.\nFeynman would later dramatize a Bayesian study by blaming rigid O-rings\nfor the Challenger shuttle explosion.\nDuring this exciting period in 1950s Chicago, Savage and Allen Wallis\nfounded the university\u2019s statistics department, and Savage attracted a number\nof young stars in the field. Reading widely, Savage discovered the work of\n\u00c9mile Borel, Frank Ramsey, and Bruno de Finetti from the 1920s and 1930s\nlegitimizing the subjectivity in Bayesian methods.\nSavage\u2019s revolutionary book Foundations of Statistics was the third in the\nseries of pathbreaking Bayesian publications in the fifties. It appeared in\n1954, four years after Bailey\u2019s insurance paper and Good\u2019s book and one\nyear after Lindley\u2019s paper.

As Savage explained, when he wrote the book he was \u201cnot yet a\npersonalistic Bayesian.\u201d He thought he came to Bayesian statistics \u201cseriously\nonly through recognition of the likelihood principle; and it took me a year or\ntwo to make the transition.\u201d21\nAccording to the likelihood principle, all the information in experimental\ndata gets encapsulated in the likelihood portion of Bayes\u2019 theorem, the part\ndescribing the probability of objective new data; the prior played no role.\nPractically speaking, the principle greatly streamlined analysis. Scientists\ncould stop running an experiment when they were satisfied with the result or\nran out of time, money, and patience; nonBayesians had to continue until\nsome frequency criterion was met. Bayesians would also be able to\nconcentrate on what happened, not on what could have happened according\nto Neyman-Pearson\u2019s sampling plan.\nThe transition to Bayes took Savage several years, but by the early 1960s\nhe had accepted its logic wholeheartedly, fusing subjective probability with\nnew statistical tools for scientific inference and decision making. As far as\nSavage was concerned, Bayes\u2019 rule filled a need that other statistical\nprocedures could not. Frequentism\u2019s origin in genetics and biology meant it\nwas involved with group phenomena, populations, and large aggregations of\nsimilar objects. As for using statistical methods in biology or physics, the\nNobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger said, \u201cThe individual\ncase [is] entirely devoid of interest.\u201d22 Bayesians like Savage, though, could\nwork with isolated one-time events, such as the probability that a chair\nweighs 20 pounds, that a plane would be late, or that the United States would\nbe at war in five years.\nBayesians could also combine information from different sources, treat\nobservables as random variables, and assign probabilities to all of them,\nwhether they formed a bell-shaped curve or some other shape. Bayesians\nused all their available data because each fact could change the answer by a\nsmall amount. Frequency-based statisticians threw up their hands when\nSavage inquired whimsically, \u201cDoes whiskey do more harm than good in the\ntreatment of snake bite?\u201d Bayesians grinned and retorted, \u201cWhiskey probably\ndoes more harm than good.\u201d23", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2515, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d000f24-407f-462b-8002-f2297135d27f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d000f24-407f-462b-8002-f2297135d27f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bf55a4b-ee37-4457-919b-3889505b0643", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "61417c4b8a7c35ce56bbe54c2880f2c431d6f6eb7c4cc91a0a9d5ccf6ef6c348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As a movement, Bayes was looking more akin to a philosophy\u2014even a\nreligion or a state of mind\u2014than to a true-or-false scientific law like plate\ntectonics.

A huge sway of scientists says you can\u2019t use\nprobability to express your lack of knowledge or one-time events that don\u2019t\nhave any frequency to it.

Kass, a Bayesian at Carnegie\nMellon University. \u201cThere is at once a deep esthetic experience and a\npragmatic recognition of profound consequences, leading to what Einstein\ncalled \u2018the cosmic religious feeling.\u2019 Bayes Theorem gives such a feeling. It\nsays there is a simple and elegant way to combine current information with\nprior experience in order to state how much is known. It implies that\nsufficiently good data will bring previously disparate observers to\nagreement. It makes full use of available information, and it produces\ndecisions having the least possible error rate.

[that] its magical powers depend on the validity of its\nprobabilistic inputs.\u201d25\nWith zealots proselytizing Bayes as an all-encompassing panacea, the\nmethod inspired both religious devotion and dogmatic opposition. The battle\nbetween Bayesians and their equally fervent foes raged for decades and\nalienated many bystanders. As one onlooker reflected, \u201cIt was a huge food\nfight. It was devastating. They hated each other.\u201d26 A prominent statistician\nlamented, \u201cBayesian statisticians do not stick closely enough to the pattern\nlaid down by Bayes himself: if they would only do as he did and publish\nposthumously we should all be saved a lot of trouble.\u201d27\nSavage became one of the believers.

Savage recast the\ncontroversy over Bayes\u2019 rule in its most extreme form as subjectivity versus\nobjectivity.

Although\nhis department colleagues knew nothing about it, the administration was\ntrying to abolish the statistics department, and Savage was fighting to get the\ndecision reversed. His marriage was disintegrating and, hoping to save it, he\nmoved to the University of Michigan. As he departed, he told his colleagues,\n\u201cI proved the Bayesian argument in 1954. None of you have found a flaw in\nthe proof and yet you still deny it. Why?\u201d29 When he tried to return to\nChicago, members of the department he had formed and chaired voted against\nrehiring him. At first, no other American or British university would offer\nhim a position. In 1964 he moved to Yale University, remarried, and\nachieved some level of tranquility.\nIn 1971, at the age of 53, Savage died suddenly of a heart attack. His death\nat midcareer deprived American Bayesians of their leading spokesman. The\nNew Haven Register had another perspective. Savage had cowritten a book\ncalled How to Gamble If You Must. For Bayesians, all assumptions about the\nfuture were risky, and gambling was the paradigm of decision making. The\nRegister headlined his obituary, \u201cYale Statistician Leonard Savage Dies;\nAuthored Book on Gambling.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Lindley had moved back to Britain, where for many years\nhe was the only Bayesian in a position of authority. In time he built not just\nBayesian theory but also strong Bayesian research groups, first at the\nUniversity College of Wales in Aberystwyth and then at University College\nLondon.

He fought to get\nBayesians appointed, professorship by professorship, until the United\nKingdom had a core of ten Bayesian departments. Eventually, Britain became\nmore sympathetic to the method than the United States, where Neyman\nmaintained Berkeley as an anti-Bayesian bunker. Still, the process left scars:\ndespite Lindley\u2019s landmark contributions he was never named a Fellow of\nthe Royal Society. In 1977, at the age of 54, Lindley forsook the\nadministrative chores he hated and retired early. He celebrated his freedom\nby growing a beard and becoming what he called \u201can itinerant scholar\u201d for\nBayes\u2019 rule.33\nThanks to Lindley in Britain and Savage in the United States, Bayesian\ntheory came of age in the 1960s. The philosophical rationale for using\nBayesian methods had been largely settled. It was becoming the only\nmathematics of uncertainty with an explicit, powerful, and secure foundation\nin logic. How to apply it, though, remained a controversial question.\nLindley\u2019s enormous influence as a teacher and organizer bore fruit in the\ngeneration to come, while Savage\u2019s book spread Bayesian methods to the\nmilitary and to business, history, game theory, psychology, and beyond.\nAlthough Savage wrote about rabbit ears and neon light in beer, he\npersonally encouraged researchers who would apply Bayes\u2019 rule to life-and-\ndeath problems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1953, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "422c6590-1590-4427-9d92-c4bb18121b0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "422c6590-1590-4427-9d92-c4bb18121b0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a45de5d-702e-4a05-8e89-1b4902c22d3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "6f89694188438c9bb4fb850fc011d158dfa244f4f3301a20b66e798484e1be1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8.\n \njerome cornfield, lung cancer, and\nheart attacks\n \nBayes came to medical research through the efforts of a single scientist,\nJerome Cornfield, whose only degree was a B.A. in history and who relied\non the rule to identify the causes of lung cancer and heart attacks.\nLung cancer, extremely rare before 1900 and still uncommon in 1930,\nsprang up as if out of nowhere shortly after the Second World War.

The federal\ngovernment, desperate for economic data during the Depression, had hired\n\u201cbright guys\u201d to replace the clerks who had traditionally compiled statistics\non unemployment, national income, housing, agriculture, and industry.1\nCornfield qualified as a bright guy, so he signed on as a government\nstatistician for \n 26.31 a week, \n 1,368 a year.\nWashington, D.C., was still a segregated, southern city. \u201cThe rule of thumb\nwas that, if you were Jewish, you could work for the Department of Labor\nand, if you were Catholic, you could work for the Department of Commerce,\u201d\nexplained Marvin Hoffenberg, a friend of Cornfield\u2019s and later a UCLA\nprofessor.2 So Cornfield went to Labor. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\nran a so-called Graduate School where mathematically inclined government\nemployees could study statistics, and Cornfield took his only mathematics\nand statistics courses there.\nAs Cornfield recalled, \u201cNobody knew how many unemployed there were,\nand sampling seemed the way to find out. . . . Statistics had me hooked.\u201d3\nAlthough both Fisher and Neyman lectured on sampling methods at the\nGraduate School, its director, W. Edwards Deming, was open-minded; he\npublished Thomas Bayes\u2019 essay with an introduction by Edward Molina of\nBell Laboratories.\nFriends referred to Cornfield\u2019s tenure at the Department of Labor as his\nserious and exotic phase. He played a major role in revising the Consumer\nPrice Index and in creating one for occupied Japan after the Second World\nWar. But he was \u201ca different kind of a guy,\u201d a friend recalled.4 Unable to\nthink of any good reason for shaving, he grew a little pointed beard, and with\nhis long gaunt frame and an umbrella over his arm he resembled an elegant\ndiplomat strolling jauntily to work. At a time when few others would, he\nshared his office with a woman statistician and an African American\nstatistical clerk.

Because\ninfectious diseases were in decline in the United States, NIH epidemiologists\nwere attacking chronic diseases, particularly cancer, heart attacks, and\ndiabetes. To assist them, NIH hired a few people with strong quantitative\nbackgrounds. Only one of them had so much as a master\u2019s degree.\nBiostatistics was a professional backwater, and throughout the 1950s and\n1960s NIH employed only ten or 20 statisticians at any one time. It was this\nsmall band that introduced statistical methods to NIH researchers in biology\nand medicine.\nBy 1950 most men in the United States smoked, and smoking rates were\nincreasing, especially among women. The favorite brands were unfiltered\nCamels, Lucky Strikes, Chesterfields, and Philip Morris. When Lorillard\nTobacco Company introduced filtered Kents in 1952, the filters contained\nasbestos, which was not removed until 1957. When 14 studies conducted in\nfive countries showed that lung cancer patients included an alarming\npercentage of heavy smokers, both Cornfield and his wife quit their 2\u00bd-\npack-a-day habits.\nCornfield realized that the Hill and Wynder studies did not directly answer\nthe questions physicians and their frightened patients were asking: what is my\nrisk? The studies showed the percentages of smokers among groups of\npeople with and without lung cancer, but they did not say what proportion of\nsmokers and nonsmokers was likely to develop lung cancer.\nThe surest and most direct way to answer the public\u2019s fears was to follow\nlarge groups of smokers and nonsmokers for years, prospectively, to see how\nmany of each group developed lung cancer. Unfortunately, studies about the\nfuture of large populations require a great deal of money and time, especially\nfor relatively rare problems like lung cancer. That is why Hill and Doll had\norganized their study as a retrospective one, choosing people who already\nhad lung cancer and asking them about their health histories. Such studies are\na relatively quick, cheap way to identify potential causes of a particular\ndisease. As a statistician, however, Cornfield suspected that retrospective\nstudies like Hill and Doll\u2019s could also be used to answer the individual\u2019s\nhaunting question, What\u2019s the chance that I or my loved ones will get this\nfatal disease?\nIn 1951 Cornfield used Bayes\u2019 rule to help answer the puzzle.

Bayes\u2019 rule provided a\nfirm theoretical link, a bridge, if you will, between the risk of disease in the\npopulation at large and the risk of disease in a subgroup, in this case\nsmokers. Cornfield was using Bayes as a philosophy-free mathematical\nstatement, as a step in calculations that would yield useful results. He had not\nyet embraced Bayes as an all-encompassing philosophy.\nCornfield\u2019s paper stunned research epidemiologists. More than anything\nelse, it helped advance the hypothesis that cigarette smoking was a cause of\nlung cancer. Out of necessity, but without any theoretical justification,\nepidemiologists had been using case studies of patients to point to possible\ncauses of problems. Cornfield\u2019s paper showed clearly that under certain\nconditions (that is, when subjects in a study were carefully matched with\ncontrols) patients\u2019 histories could indeed help measure the strength of the\nlink between a disease and its possible cause. Epidemiologists could\nestimate disease risk rates by analyzing nonexperimental clinical data\ngleaned from patient histories. By validating research findings arising from\ncase-control studies, Cornfield made much of modern epidemiology\npossible. In 1961, for example, case-control studies would help identify the\nantinausea drug thalidomide as the cause of serious birth defects.\nTwo massive efforts in England and the United States during the mid-\n1950s confirmed Cornfield\u2019s judgment. Because many people had rejected\nthe findings of their retrospective study, Hill and Doll had decided to take a\ndirect approach and conduct a prospective study. They questioned 40,000\nBritish physicians about their current smoking habits and then followed them\nfor five years to see who got lung cancer. In a parallel U.S. study, E. Cuyler\nHammond and Daniel Horn followed 187,783 men aged 50 to 69 in New\nYork State for more than 3\u00bd years. Death rates in both countries were\nsimilar: heavy smokers were 22 to 24 times more likely to get lung cancer\nthan nonsmokers and, in another surprise discovery, were 42% and 57%\nmore likely to get, respectively, heart and circulatory diseases. Research also\nshowed that cigarettes were more dangerous than pipes, although the risk\ndeclined after smoking stopped.\nSurprisingly, neither Fisher nor Neyman could accept research results\nshowing that cigarettes caused lung cancer.

In 1955 they launched a vigorous counterattack, arguing that only\nexperimental data from strictly controlled laboratory and field experiments\ncould predict future disease rates.

According to Doll, Fisher even went so far as to accuse\nHill of scientific dishonesty. Over the course of three years Fisher developed\ntwo remarkable hypotheses. The first, believe it or not, was that lung cancer\nmight cause smoking. The second was that a latent genetic factor might give\nsome people hereditary predilections for both smoking and lung cancer. In\nneither case would smoking cause lung cancer.\nCornfield maintained a running argument with Fisher through the 1950s.\nCornfield was already thinking deeply about the standards of evidence\nneeded before observational data could establish cause and effect. Finally, in\n1959, he raked Fisher over the coals about smoking with a common-sense,\nnonmathematical paper that reads like a legal brief. In that seminal paper he\nand five coauthors systematically addressed every one of Fisher\u2019s alternative\nexplanations for the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. They\nhurled one counterargument after another at Fisher\u2019s hypothetical genetic\nfactor.

When the U.S. surgeon general\nconcluded in 1964 that \u201ccigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer\nin men,\u201d he cited Cornfield\u2019s work.7 Nonexperimental studies had helped\nidentify an association between smoking and lung cancer.

Today, thanks to Cornfield, case-control\nstudies are the primary tool epidemiologists use to identify likely causes of\nchronic diseases.\nOver his career, Cornfield would become involved in every major public\nhealth problem of the day. Most of them, including smoking, the safety of\npolio vaccines, and the efficacy of diabetes treatments, were fiercely\ncontroversial.\nTo calm the statistics phobia of physicians and epidemiologists, Cornfield\ndeveloped an easygoing bedside manner. Abandoning his serious phase, he\ncultivated an infectious laugh and an irrepressible air of informality. By\nmixing humor into conversations, telling stories, and laughing heartily he\ninspired tremendous confidence. Even his gait and prose became sprightly.\nSoon every biomedical scientist with a committee and a controversy wanted\nCornfield on board. By pointing out common elements that everyone shared,\nhe could unify the most disparate group. After one particularly onerous series\nof meetings and reports, a committee member asked him, \u201cDid you get my\nlast letter about sample size?\u201d There was a pause, and Cornfield grinned and\nsaid, \u201cChrist, I hope so.\u201d When the committee finally produced its massive\nprocedural manual, Cornfield waved it over his head, declaring, \u201cYou know,\nsay what you will about the Ten Commandments, you must come back to the\npleasant fact that there were only ten of them.\u201d\nCornfield typically rose at 5 a.m. to write and make paper-and-pencil\ncalculations.

Death rates from cardiovascular disease had been rising\nsteadily in the United States since 1900. Heart disease had been the nation\u2019s\nleading cause of death since 1921, and strokes the third leading cause since\n1938. Yet researchers at the midpoint of the twentieth century were as\nignorant of the causes of heart disease and stroke as they had been of lung\ncancer.\nUnderstanding the causes of deaths from cardiovascular disease would\nrequire following a population for many years. A prospective study,\nhowever, was more feasible than with lung cancer because heart problems\nwere far more common. In 1948 Cornfield helped design the Framingham\nHeart Study, which has since followed the health of three generations of\nFramingham, Massachusetts, residents.\nAs one of the first important studies based on Framingham, Cornfield\nfollowed 1,329 adult male residents for a decade. Between 1948 and 1958,\n92 of the group experienced myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.\nLongitudinal studies like Framingham are designed to investigate a large\nvariety of variables, both singly and jointly, on the risk of developing a\ndisease.

He chose Bayes\u2019 rule and used cardiovascular\ndeath rates as the prior. Framingham gave him data about two groups of\npeople, those who had died of heart disease and those who had not. Within\neach group he had information about seven risk factors. Calculating Bayes\u2019\nrule, he got a posterior probability in the form of a logistic regression\nfunction, which he then used to identify the four most important risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease. In addition to age itself, they were cholesterol,\ncigarette smoking, heart abnormalities, and blood pressure.\nBayes allowed Cornfield to reframe Framingham\u2019s data in terms of the\nprobability that people with particular characteristics would get heart\ndisease. There was no critical level for cholesterol or blood pressure below\nwhich people were safe and above which they got the disease. And patients\ncursed with both high cholesterol and high blood pressure were 23% more at\nrisk for heart attacks than those with low cholesterol and blood pressure\nrates.\nCornfield\u2019s identification in 1962 of the most critical risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease produced one of the most important public health\nachievements of the twentieth century: a dramatic drop in death rates from\ncardiovascular disease. Between 1960 and 1996 they fell 60%, preventing\n621,000 fatalities.

When Cornfield discovered that\nBayesian methods would let him reject some hypotheses after only two\nsolidly adverse observations, he was converted. He had started out using\nBayes\u2019 theorem as an enabling tool to solve a particular problem, the way it\nhad been used for cryptography, submarine hunting, and artillery fire during\nthe Second World War. But now he was moving gradually toward making\nBayes\u2019 theorem the foundation of a broad philosophy for handling\ninformation and uncertainties. As he began thinking about Bayes as a\nphilosophy rather than just a tool, he became part of the profound conversion\nthat Jeffreys, Savage, Lindley, and others were also going through in the\n1950s and 1960s. While Fisher considered a hypothesis significant if it was\nunlikely to have occurred by chance, Cornfield declared airily, \u201cIf\nmaintenance of [Fisher\u2019s] significance level interferes with the release of\ninterim results, all I can say is so much the worse for the significance\nlevel.\u201d10\nInterestingly, most of NIH\u2019s other statisticians failed to follow their leader\ninto Bayesian fields. Cornfield published scientifically important papers\nabout Bayesian inference in mainstream statistics journals. Nevertheless,\nwhen he included Bayesian methods in some of the trials he worked on, their\nmain conclusions were based on frequentism. It would be another 30 years\nbefore NIH started using Bayes for clinical trials. Savage thought that many\nresearchers were content to reap the benefits of Bayes\u2019 theorem without\nembracing the method.\nCornfield declared cheerily, however, \u201cBayes\u2019 theorem has come back\nfrom the cemetery to which it has been consigned.\u201d11\nIn 1967 Cornfield retired from NIH and moved later to George Washington\nUniversity, where he chaired the statistics department and developed Bayes\u2019\nrule into a full-scale logical mathematical approach. In one paper he proved\nto the satisfaction of many Bayesians that, according to frequency rules, any\nstatistical procedure that does not stem from a prior can be improved upon.\nDespite his Bayesian conversion, Cornfield was in great demand as a\nconsultant.

Gen. Curtis E. LeMay,\nthe commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), had helped start it in\nSanta Monica, California, 10 years earlier as \u201ca gimmick\u201d to cajole top\nscientists into applying operations research to long-range air warfare.1 But\nRAND, an acronym for Research ANd Development, considered itself a\n\u201cuniversity without students\u201d and its 1,000-odd employees \u201cdefense\nintellectuals.\u201d Their mission was to use mathematics, statistics, and\ncomputers to solve military problems, pioneer decision making under\nconditions of uncertainty, and save the United States from Soviet attack. The\nU.S. Air Force, which funded RAND, gave its researchers carte blanche to\nchoose the problems they wanted to investigate. But since President\nEisenhower\u2019s \u201cNew Look\u201d military policy depended on early nuclear\nbombing (\u201cmassive retaliation\u201d) as the cheapest way to respond to a Soviet\nattack, RAND\u2019s top issues were nuclear strategy, surviving nuclear attack,\nand response options. Because SAC bombers had a monopoly on\ntransporting America\u2019s nuclear arsenal and General LeMay sat at the\npinnacle of the world\u2019s military might, RAND\u2019s voice was often influential.\nBy the time Savage visited Santa Monica that summer RAND reports had\nalready challenged some of SAC\u2019s sacred cows.

In retaliation, SAC would almost break off relations with RAND on\nseveral occasions between Savage\u2019s visit in 1957 and 1961.\nCirculating gregariously among RAND researchers that summer, Savage\nmet Fred Charles Ikl\u00e9, a young Swiss-born demographer who had studied the\nsociological effects of nuclear bombing on urban populations. At 33, Ikl\u00e9\nwas seven years younger than Savage and had earned a Ph.D. in 1950 from\nthe University of Chicago, where Savage was teaching. Seeking a wide-open\nfield that no one else at RAND was studying, Ikl\u00e9 chose nuclear catastrophes\nthat an Anglo-American nuclear arsenal would not deter: those caused by\naccident or by someone mentally deranged.

Eventually the issue came around to the question, what was the\nprobability of an accidental H-bomb explosion?\nAfter a summer of conversations, Savage was preparing to return to\nacademia when Albert Madansky, a 23-year-old Ph.D. graduate of Savage\u2019s\nstatistics department, arrived at RAND. Madansky had financed his graduate\nstudies by working part-time for Arthur Bailey, the Bayesian theorist in the\ninsurance industry. Until Bailey\u2019s death, he had considered an actuarial\ncareer. Savage, who had published his book Foundations of Statistics but\nhad not yet embraced Bayes\u2019 rule, talked over the H-bomb problem with\nMadansky without considering it in Bayesian terms. As he left Santa Monica,\nhe handed over the H-bomb study to Madansky but left the young man to do\nas he saw fit. Madansky would come up with a Bayesian approach on his\nown.\nBecause RAND\u2019s report on the project would eventually be classified,\nMadansky could not talk about his work for 41 years.

Bayes\u2019 rule was emerging in fits and starts from the secrecy\nof the Second World War and the Cold War.\nThe H-bomb problem facing Madansky was politically and statistically\ntricky. No atomic or hydrogen weapon had ever exploded accidentally. In the\n12 years since the United States had dropped atomic bombs on Japan in\nAugust 1945, nuclear bombs had been detonated, but always deliberately, as\npart of a weapons test. Barring accidents, the nation\u2019s leaders believed that\ntheir stocks of nuclear weapons deterred all chance of thermonuclear war\u2014\nand that accidents could not occur in the future because none had occurred in\nthe past. Nonetheless, the question remained: could the impossible happen?\nAccording to more than a century of conventional statistics, the impossible\ncould not be calculated. Jakob Bernoulli had decreed in 1713 that highly\nimprobable events do not happen. David Hume agreed, arguing that because\nthe sun had risen thousands of times in the past it would continue to do so. It\nwas Thomas Bayes\u2019 friend and editor, Richard Price, who took the contrary\nview that the highly improbable could still occur. During the nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries, Antoine-Augustin Cournot concluded that the\nprobability of a physically impossible event was infinitely small and thus the\nevent would never occur. Andrei Kolmogorov slightly refined \u201cnever\u201d by\nsaying that if the probability of an event is very small, we can be practically\ncertain that the event will not happen in the very next trial.\nFisher was no help either. He argued that probability is a simple relative\nfrequency in an infinitely large population; until a nuclear bomb accident\noccurred, he had no way of judging its future probability. Mercifully,\nMadansky did not have an infinitely large population of H-bomb accidents,\nand further experimentation was out of the question. Fisher\u2019s approach left\nhim with the banal observation that zero accidents had occurred and that the\nprobability of a future accident was also zero.\nMadansky concluded, \u201cAs long as you are set that the probability is going\nto be zero, then nothing\u2019s going to change your mind. If you have decided that\nthe sun rises each morning because it has always done so in the past, nothing\nis going to change your mind except one morning when the sun fails to\nappear.\u201d3\nHe did not buy the argument that an accident could never occur simply\nbecause none had happened in the past. First, the political and military\nestablishment\u2019s assumption that a well-stocked American arsenal of nuclear\nweapons would deter war rested on increasingly shaky grounds.

The USSR had\nlaunched the first man-made satellite into orbit around Earth in 1957.\nMeanwhile, the United States trained countries in the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) to fire nuclear weapons and supplied Britain, Italy,\nand Turkey with nuclear missiles. By the time the Anglo-American\nAgreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual\nDefense Purposes was signed in 1958, all hope of preventing the spread of\nnuclear weapons had evaporated. France tested its first atomic bomb in\n1960.\nIn addition to the rapid expansion of nuclear weapons, Madansky had 16\ntop-secret reasons for doubting that the probability of a future accident was\nzero. A classified list detailed 16 of \u201cthe more dramatic incidents\u201d involving\nnuclear weapons between 1950 and 1958.4 They included accidental drops,\njettisons, aircraft crashes, and testing errors. Incidents had occurred off\nBritish Columbia and in California, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida, Georgia,\nSouth Carolina, and overseas.

Only if these high explosives blow up at the same instant can the\nuranium or plutonium capsule be sufficiently compressed on all sides to\ntrigger a nuclear blast. In a few cases these conventional explosives had\ndetonated, generally on impact in a plane crash. Because the capsule of\nnuclear material had not been installed inside the weapons, however, there\nhad been no nuclear accidents. That fact had convinced SAC that its\nprocedures were sound and that no nuclear accident would occur.\nStill, scores of people had died when the high explosives in unarmed\nnuclear weapons blew up. The year 1950 was a banner year for accidents.\nOn April 11, 1950, 13 people died near Kirtland Air Force Base, outside\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, when a B-29 crashed into a mountain; flames\nfrom the high explosives were visible for 15 miles.

At that\ntime, SAC\u2019s B-52 jet-powered Stratofortress bombers carried up to four\nnuclear bombs, each with an explosive power between 1 million and 24\nmillion tons of TNT, or up to 1,850 Hiroshima bombs. The United States was\nalso planning to outfit intercontinental ballistic missiles with hydrogen\nwarheads, accelerate the production of intermediate range ballistic missiles,\nand negotiate with NATO countries for launching rights and military bases.\nThe military would soon be dealing with shorter alarm times, increased\nalertness, and more decentralized weaponry, all factors that could increase\nthe likelihood of a catastrophe.\nMadansky calculated the number of \u201caccident opportunities\u201d based on the\nnumber of weapons, their longevity, and the number of times they were\naboard planes or handled in storage.13 Accident opportunities corresponded\nto flipping coins and throwing dice.

LeMay had directed the fire-\nbombing of Japanese cities during the Second World War, his ghostwritten\nautobiography would propose bombing the Vietnamese \u201cback into the Stone\nAge\u201d in the mid-1960s, and he was the model for \u201cBuck\u201d Turgidson, the\ninsanely warlike, cigar-chomping general played by George C.

His son-in-law George E. P. Box was the young chemist who had to\nsay he was transporting a horse in order to consult Fisher during the Second\nWorld War. Like Fisher, Box came to believe that statistics should be more\nclosely entwined with science than with mathematics. This view was\nreinforced by Box\u2019s later work for the chemical giant ICI in Britain and for\nthe quality control movement with W. Edwards Deming and the Japanese\nauto industry.\nWhen Box organized a statistics department at the University of Wisconsin\nin 1960, he taught for the first time, a class called Foundations of Statistics.\n\u201cWeek after week,\u201d he said, \u201cI prepared my notes very carefully.

Statisticians called it Stein\u2019s Paradox. Stein called it\nshrinkage. As a frequency-based theorist, he studiously avoided discussing\nits relationship with Bayes.\nStein\u2019s Paradox, however, works for comparisons between related\nstatistics: the egg production of different chicken breeds, the batting averages\nof various baseball players, or the workers\u2019 compensation exposure of\nroofing companies. Traditionally, for example, farmers comparing the egg\nproduction of five chicken breeds would average the egg yields of each\nbreed separately. But what if a traveling salesman advertised a breed of\nhens, and each one supposedly laid a million eggs? Because of their prior\nknowledge of poultry, farmers would laugh him out of town. Bayesians\ndecided that Stein, like the farmers, had weighted his average with a sort of\nsuper-or hyperdistribution about chicken-ness, information about egg laying\ninherent in each breed but never before considered. And intrinsic to poultry\nfarming is the fact that one hen never lays a million eggs.\nIn like manner, Stein\u2019s system used prior information to explain the\nhitherto mediocre batter who begins a new season hitting a spectacular .400.\nStein\u2019s Paradox tells fans not to forget their previous knowledge of the sport\nand the batting averages of other players.\nWhen Stein and Willard D. James simplified the method in 1961, they\nproduced another surprise\u2014the same Bayes-based formula that actuaries had\nused earlier in the century to price workers\u2019 compensation insurance\npremiums. Whitney\u2019s actuarial Credibility theorem used x = P + z(p\u2013P), and\nStein and James used z = \n  + c(y\u2013y): identical formulas but with different\nsymbols and names. In both cases, data about related quantities were being\nconcentrated, made more credible or shrunk, until they clustered more tightly\naround the mean. With it, actuaries made more accurate predictions about the\nfuture well-being of workers in broad industrial categories. Only Arthur\nBailey had recognized the formula\u2019s Bayesian roots and realized it would be\nequally valid for noninsurance situations.\nDelighted Bayesians claimed Stein was using the prior context of his\nnumbers to shrink the range of possible answers and make for better\npredictions.

Lindley\u2019s Paradox occurs when a precise hypothesis is\ntested with vast amounts of data. In 1987, Princeton University aeronautics\nengineering professor Robert G. Jahn conducted a large study which he\nconcluded supported the existence of psychokinetic powers. He reported that\na random event generator had produced 104,490,000 trials testing the\nhypothesis that someone on a couch eight feet away cannot influence their\nresults any more than random chance would. Jahn reported that the random\nevent generator produced 18,471 more examples (0.018%) of human\ninfluence on his sensitive microelectronic equipment than could be expected\nwith chance alone. Even with a p-value as small as 0.00015, the frequentist\nwould reject the hypothesis (and conclude in favor of psychokinetic powers)\nwhile the same evidence convinces a Bayesian that the hypothesis against\nspiritualism is almost certainly true.\nSix years later, Jimmie Savage, Harold Lindman, and Ward Edwards at the\nUniversity of Michigan showed that results using Bayes and the frequentist\u2019s\np-values could differ by significant amounts even with everyday-sized data\nsamples; for instance, a Bayesian with any sensible prior and a sample of\nonly 20 would get an answer ten times or more larger than the p-value.\nLindley ran afoul of Fisher\u2019s temper when he reviewed Fisher\u2019s third\nbook and found \u201cwhat I thought was a very basic, serious error in it: Namely,\nthat [Fisher\u2019s] fiducial probability doesn\u2019t obey the rules of probability. He\nsaid it did. He was wrong; it didn\u2019t, and I produced an example. He was\nfurious with me.\u201d A sympathetic colleague warned Lindley that Fisher was\nlivid, but \u201cit was not until the book of Fisher\u2019s letters was published that I\nrealized the full force of his fury.

I was very worried, but Savage leapt\nto my defense and dealt with the situation, I think very well.\u201d15\nOne day in the mid-1960s Box dared to tackle his irascible father-in-law\nabout equal priors. Fisher had come to see his new granddaughter, and\nfriends had warned Box he could get only so far with Fisher before he\nexploded. Walking up the hill to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Box\ntold the old man, \u201cI\u2019ll give them equal probabilities, so if I have five\nhypotheses, each has a probability of one-fifth.\u201d16\nFisher responded in a rather annoyed way, as if to say, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m\ngoing to say and then you\u2019re going to shut up.\u201d He declared, \u201cThinking that\nyou don\u2019t know and thinking that the probabilities of all the possibilities are\nequal is not the same thing.\u201d17 That distinction, which Box later agreed with,\nprevented Fisher from accepting Bayes\u2019 rule. Like Neyman, Fisher agreed\nthat if he ever saw a prior he could believe, he would use Bayes-Laplace.\nAnd in fact he did. Because he knew the pedigrees of his laboratory animals\ngenerations back, he could confidently specify the initial probabilities of\nparticular crosses. For those experiments Fisher did use Bayes\u2019 rule. Later,\nBox said sadly that he divorced Fisher\u2019s daughter because she had inherited\na temper much like her father\u2019s.\nA compromise between Bayesian and anti-Bayesian methods began to\nlook attractive.

Laplace\u2019s continuous form of Bayes\u2019 rule called\nfor integration of functions. This could be complicated, and as the number of\nunknowns rose, integration problems became hopelessly difficult given the\ncomputational capabilities of the time. Jeffreys, Lindley, and David Wallace\nwere among those who worked on developing asymptotic approximations to\nmake the calculations more manageable.\nAmid this mathematical fervor, a few practical types sat down in the\n1960s to build the kind of institutional support that frequentists had long\nenjoyed: annual seminars, journals, funding sources, and textbooks. Morris\nH. DeGroot wrote the first internationally known text on Bayesian decision\ntheory, the mathematical analysis of decision making. Arnold Zellner at the\nUniversity of Chicago raised money, founded a conference series, and began\ntesting standard economics problems one by one, solving them from both\nBayesian and nonBayesian points of view. Thanks to Zellner\u2019s influence,\nSavage\u2019s subjective probability would have one of its biggest impacts in\neconomics. The building process took decades. The International Society for\nBayesian Analysis and the Bayesian section of the American Statistical\nAssociation were not formed until the early 1990s.\nThe excitement over Bayesian theory extended far beyond statistics and\nmathematics though. During the 1960s and 1970s, physicians, National\nSecurity Agency cryptanalysts, Central Intelligence Agency analysts, and\nlawyers also began to consider Bayesian applications in their fields.\nPhysicians began talking about applying Bayes to medical diagnosis in\n1959, when Robert S. Ledley of the National Bureau of Standards and Lee B.\nLusted of the University of Rochester School of Medicine suggested the idea.\nThey published their article in Science because medical journals were\nuninterested.

Agency analysts typically made one\nprediction and left it at that; they ignored unlikely but potentially catastrophic\npossibilities and failed to update their initial predictions with new evidence.\nAlthough the CIA concluded that Bayes-based analyses were more insightful,\nthey were judged too slow. The experiments were abandoned for lack of\ncomputer power.\nThe legal profession reacted differently.

At Amherst College he majored in classics\nand ancient history and took courses in economics and physics. He enrolled\nin calculus, his only formal math class, solely to capture a large cash prize\nfor the best student. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa at the age of 19, he\nstudied in Athens at the American School of Classical Studies between 1937\nand 1939 and earned a Ph.D. in ancient history at Harvard in 1940. Over the\nnext few years he published several articles about religious cults and slavery\nin ancient Greece. Schlaifer was a quick study, and he filled in for Harvard\nhistorians, economists, and physicists as they left for defense work during the\nSecond World War.\nEventually, Schlaifer was assigned to the university\u2019s Underwater Sound\nLaboratory, where sonar was developed. He and theoretical physicist Edwin\nKemble tried to silence submarine torpedo propellers the better to attack\nGerman U-boats. Schlaifer understood the scientific issues well enough to\nsolve equations using Marchant or Frieden electromechanical calculators and\nto turn technical reports into prose. The war gave him a voracious appetite\nfor practical, real-world problems, and he abandoned ancient history.\nAfter the war Schlaifer\u2019s physics impressed the Harvard Business School\nenough to hire him to fulfill a departmental obligation: a study of the aircraft\nengine industry. He turned the low-status assignment into a triumph, a\n600page classic on aviation history, Development of Aircraft Engines,\nDevelopment of Aircraft Fuel.\nBetween his war work and the book, Schlaifer acquired a usefully\nintimidating campus reputation as a physicist, later cemented by his obituary\nin the New York Times. He was teaching accounting and production when the\nbusiness school, despite his spectacularly unsuitable training, assigned him\nto teach statistical quality control. Knowing nothing about statistics, Schlaifer\ncrammed by reading the dominant theoreticians of the day, Fisher, Neyman,\nand Egon Pearson.

But frequentism offered businesses no help when it\ncame to issues like launching a new product or changing a price.\nSchlaifer\u2019s publications later described modest pleas for help from a\nnewsstand owner unsure of how many copies of the Daily Racing Form to\nstock, and from a wholesaler worried about allocating his ten delivery trucks\nbetween two warehouses. With luck, business owners might make the right\ndecisions. But given the uncertainties involved in even these simple\nproblems, Schlaifer wondered how they could ever hope to systematically\nmake the best possible choices. Even if they could collect additional\ninformation by sampling or experimentation, would it be worth the cost?\nAccording to frequentists, objective statistics were synonymous with long-\nrun relative frequency, and probabilities were invalid unless based on\nrepeatable observations. Frequentists dealt with a rich abundance of directly\nrelevant data and took samples to test hypotheses and draw inferences about\nunknowns. The method worked for repetitive, standardized phenomena such\nas successive grain crops, genetics, gambling, insurance, and statistical\nmechanics.\nBut business executives often had to make decisions under conditions of\nextreme uncertainty, without sample data. As Schlaifer realized, \u201cUnder\nuncertainty, the businessman is forced, in effect, to gamble, . . . hoping that he\nwill win but knowing that he may lose.\u201d4 Executives needed a way to assess\nprobabilities without the repeated trials required by frequentist methods.\nSchlaifer said teaching frequentism made him feel like a jackass. It simply\ndid not address the main problem in business: decision making under\nuncertainty.\nThinking through the problem, Schlaifer wondered how executives could\nmake decisions based on no data. Whatever prior information they had about\nthe demand for their product was obviously better than none. From there,\nSchlaifer got to the problem of how sample data should be used and how\nmuch money should be spent getting it. Updating prior information with\nsample data got him to Bayes\u2019 rule because it could combine subjectively\nassessed prior probabilities with objectively attained data. It was a\nfundamental insight that changed his life.\nSchlaifer did not have much mathematics. Innocent of the raging\nphilosophical divide between objectivists and subjectivists, Schlaifer threw\naway his books and reinvented Bayesian decision theory from scratch.

And given his iconoclastic zeal, he brazenly\nchallenged giants in the field. Like Savage, Schlaifer was combining\nuncertainty with economics in order to make decisions.

Ever curious, he demanded the\nabsolute, best possible analyses. He realized he needed mathematical help.\nHearing about a young closet Bayesian named Howard Raiffa at Columbia\nUniversity, Schlaifer scouted him out and persuaded Harvard to hire him. For\nthe next seven years Raiffa and Schlaifer collaborated closely. Raiffa went\non to become an international negotiator who wielded enormous influence on\neducation, business, the law, and public policy in the United States and\nabroad.

One day he\noverheard his army sergeants saying they wanted to line up America\u2019s Jews\non a beach and use them for target practice. Later, real estate agents in Fort\nLauderdale, Florida, refused to find housing for Raiffa and his wife because\nthey were Jewish. When a friend told him that engineering and science also\ndiscriminated against Jews, Raiffa was prepared to believe it. Then he\nlearned that insurance actuaries were graded on objective, competitive\nexaminations. Seeking a field where competence counted more than religion,\nRaiffa enrolled in the University of Michigan\u2019s actuarial program, where\nArthur Bailey had studied.\nTo Raiffa\u2019s great surprise, he became a superb and \u201cdeliriously happy\u201d\nstudent who raced through a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics, a master\u2019s\ndegree in statistics, and a doctorate in mathematics in six years between\n1946 and 1952. \u201cIn the year I studied statistics, I don\u2019t think I heard the word\n\u2018Bayes.\u2019 As a way of inference, it was nonexistent. It was all strictly\nNeyman-Pearson, classical, objectivistic (frequency-based) statistics.\u201d10\nAlthough Schlaifer had embraced Bayes in one fell swoop, Raiffa inched\ngrudgingly toward its subjectivity. But reading John von Neumann and Oskar\nMorgenstern\u2019s book Game Theory (1944), he instinctively assessed how\nothers would play in order to determine how he himself should compete: \u201cIn\nmy naivet\u00e9, without any theory or anything like that. . . . [I began] assessing\njudgmental probability distributions. I slipped into being a subjectivist\nwithout realizing how radically I was behaving. That was the natural thing to\ndo. No big deal.\u201d11\nWhen Raiffa gave a series of seminars on Abraham Wald\u2019s new book\nStatistical Decision Functions, he discovered it was full of Bayesian\ndecisionmaking rules for use in a frequentist framework. Independently of\nTuring and Barnard, Wald had discovered sequential analysis for testing\nammunition while working with the Statistical Research Group in the Fire\nControl Division of the National Defense Research Committee. Though a\nconfirmed frequentist, he sometimes solved problems in a curiously\nroundabout manner. After inventing a Bayesian prior, he would solve the\nBayesian version of his problem and then analyze its frequentist properties.\nHe also said that every good decision procedure is Bayesian and confided to\nthe statistician Hilda von Mises that he was a Bayesian but did not dare say", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2594, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79ce08af-0cfc-4e11-9a6e-82428e7d3139": {"__data__": {"id_": "79ce08af-0cfc-4e11-9a6e-82428e7d3139", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4516809d-593a-40ac-a377-468f580f55ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "07c2d1b2ff8272bac52de4317a53c30ae3c0650dbcb8aa62c54625b7fa0cf344", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "so publicly. His work would have a large impact on many mathematical\nstatisticians and decision theorists, including Raiffa.\nUntil Wald\u2019s book appeared, the word \u201cBayesian\u201d had referred only to\nThomas Bayes\u2019 controversial suggestion about equal priors, not to his\ntheorem for solving inverse probability problems. After Wald died in a plane\ncrash in India in 1950, the Columbia University statistics department hired\nRaiffa to teach Wald\u2019s course. Raiffa kept a day ahead of his students by\nreading the textbook every night. He was moving gradually toward a\nviewpoint opposed by almost every statistics department in the country,\nincluding Columbia\u2019s. Giving up \u201cscientific\u201d objectivity and embracing\nsubjectivity would not be easy.\nAt first, like Schlaifer, Raiffa taught straight frequentism, using the\nthencanonical Neyman-Pearson theory, tests of hypotheses, confidence\nintervals, and unbiased estimation. But by 1955, Raiffa, like Schlaifer, no\nlonger believed these concepts were central. Columbia faculty members\nwere auditing Raiffa\u2019s lectures, and his transformation into a closet Bayesian\nleft him a nervous wreck. He did not \u201ccome out\u201d because colleagues whom\nhe admired greatly were vociferously opposed to Bayesianism. \u201cLook,\nHoward, what are you trying to do?\u201d they asked. \u201cAre you trying to introduce\nsquishy judgmental, psychological stuff into something which we think is\nscience?\u201d12\nHe and his Columbia colleagues were working on totally different kinds of\nproblems. Empowered by the Second World War, statisticians like Raiffa and\nSchlaifer were increasingly interested in using statistics not just to analyze\ndata but to make decisions. In contrast, Neyman and Pearson considered the\nerrors associated with various strategies or hypotheses and then decided\nwhether to accept or reject them; they could not infer what to do based on an\nobserved sample outcome without thinking about all the potential sample\noutcomes that could have occurred but had not. This was Jeffreys\u2019s objection\nto using frequentism for scientific inference. Raiffa felt the same way for\ndifferent reasons; he wanted to make decisions tied to \u201creal economic\nproblems; not phony ones.\u201d13\nRaiffa was interested in concrete, one-of-a-kind decisions requiring quick\njudgments about how much of a product to stock or how to price it. Like\nSchlaifer at Harvard, he wanted to help businesses resolve uncertainties and\nuse indirectly relevant information.

So the whole question of a test of\nhypotheses seemed to me to be leading students in a wrong direction.\u201d15\nThe chasm between the two schools of statistics crystallized for Raiffa\nwhen Columbia professors discussed a sociology student named James\nColeman. During his oral examination Coleman seemed \u201cconfused and fuzzy .\n. . clearly not of Ph.D. quality.\u201d16 But his professors were adamant that he\nwas otherwise dazzling. Using his new Bayesian perspective, Raiffa argued\nthat the department\u2019s prior opinion of the candidate\u2019s qualities was so\npositive that a one-hour exam should not substantially alter their views. Pass\nhim, Raiffa urged. Coleman became such an influential sociologist that he\nappeared on both the cover of Newsweek and page one of the New York\nTimes.\nSo far, Raiffa regarded his transformation from a Neyman-Pearsonite to a\nBayesian as an intellectual conversion; his emotional conversion was still to\ncome.\nIn a campaign to raise the intellectual standards of business schools, the\nFord Foundation donated money to Harvard to hire a mathematical\nstatistician in 1957. The university made Raiffa an attractive offer: joint\nposts in its new department of statistics and in the business school.

In\nturn, Savage recognized that Schlaifer had developed his ideas \u201cwholly\nindependently\u201d and was more \u201cdown to earth and less spellbound by\ntradition.\u201d26\nMulling over the state of Bayes\u2019 rule, Schlaifer and Raiffa realized that\nBayesians, unlike frequentists, had no bookshelves of mathematical tools\nready for use. As a result, Bayesian methods were regarded as impractically\ncomplicated, particularly by business students, who were often\nmathematically unprepared. While theoreticians like Savage and Lindley\ntried to make Bayes mathematically respectable, Raiffa and Schlaifer set out\nin 1958 to make it fully operational and easy to use for bread-and-butter\nproblems. Like George Box, they parodied a popular song, this one from\nAnnie Get Your Gun, claiming that anything a frequentist could do, they could\ndo better.\nTo make calculations easier, they introduced decision trees, tree-flipping,\nand conjugate priors. \u201cI began using decision tree diagrams that depicted the\nsequential nature of decision problems faced by business managers,\u201d Raiffa\nsaid. \u201cShould I, as decision maker, act now or wait to collect further\nmarketing information (by sampling or further engineering)? . . . I never made\nany claim to being the inventor of the decision tree but . . . I became known\nas Mr. Decision Tree.\u201d27 Soon the diagrams of Bayes\u2019 decisionmaking\nprocess were, like many-branched trees, rooted in undergraduate business\ncurricula. The trees are probably the best-known practical application of\nBayes\u2019 rule.\nTree-flipping began as a simplification to help one of Raiffa\u2019s graduate\nstudents who was interested in wildcat drilling for oil. Normally, a\nwildcatter decided whether to test a particular site before deciding to drill or\nnot drill. To avoid some messy algebra, Raiffa flipped the order of the\nwildcatter\u2019s decision. He dealt with the probability that test results would be\npositive or negative before he considered whether or not to conduct the test.\nWorking through the diagram produced information about x\u2019s followed by\ny\u2019s. Tree-flipping put the y\u2019s first.

We had\npeople doing complicated things that could have been done by Bayes, but we\ndidn\u2019t do it by Bayes. We did it by tree-flipping.\u201d28\nRaiffa also developed a handy shortcut for updating priors and posteriors.\nCalled conjugate prior distributions, it used the fact that in many cases the\nshape or curve of a probability\u2019s distribution is the same in both prior and\nposterior. Thus, if you start with normal Gaussians, you\u2019ll end up with\nnormal Gaussians. Conjugate priors paid dividends with the repeated\nupdating called for by Bayes\u2019 method. Albert Madansky used a similar\nconcept for his H-bomb study. The shortcut would later become unnecessary\nwith the adoption of Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods.\nIn a further simplification, some business Bayesians even dropped the\nprior odds called for by Bayes\u2019 rule.

And no one was sure\nwhether an expert\u2019s subjective judgment would be valid. John Pratt asked his\nwife, Joy, whose job was promoting films in local theaters, to estimate their\ndaily attendance. At first, her estimates fell into too narrow a range. By\ncomparing them with actual attendance figures\u2014hundreds of data points\ntaken night after night at two local theaters\u2014Joy Pratt learned to make such\naccurate predictions that her husband became convinced that expert opinion\ncould be useful.

The use of expert opinion for decision\nmaking later became a major field of study.\nIt turned out that Joy and John Pratt were right: marketing executives\nrisked a lot of money on the basis of very little information and loved being\nasked for their professional judgment.

DuPont, trying to decide how\nbig a factory to build for artificial shoe leather in 1962, was delighted to\nassess the prior odds of the demand for its new product. Design engineers at\nFord Motor Company were equally pleased that incorporating their opinions\ninto Bayes\u2019 prior let Ford use smaller opinion samples. Their work opened\nup just about any business problem to mathematical analysis. An engineering\nproblem might have 20 sources of uncertainty; of these, perhaps 12 could be\nhandled by single guesses; 5 needed more testing; and 2 might be so critical\nthat experts had to be interviewed. Bayes\u2019 rule was solving far more\ncomplex problems than Savage\u2019s mental exercises about curling rabbit ears.\nBetween 1961 and 1965 an exciting weekly seminar, generally followed\nby drinks in Schlaifer\u2019s office, focused on decision making under uncertainty\n(DUU for short). The seminar explored utility analysis, portfolio analysis,\ngroup decision processes, theory of syndicates, behavioral anomalies, and\nways to ask about uncertainties and values. Said Raiffa, \u201cWe helped shape a\nfield.\u201d30 The seminar and two books Raiffa and Schlaifer cowrote during this\nperiod spurred the Bayesian revival of the 1960s. Raiffa was later surprised\nto realize that the most fertile period of his collaboration with Schlaifer had\nlasted only four years.\nRaiffa\u2019s and Schlaifer\u2019s classic book for advanced statisticians, Applied\nStatistical Decision Theory, was published in 1961. Its careful, detailed\nanalytical methods set the direction of Bayesian statistics for the next two\ndecades. Today it sits on almost every decision analyst\u2019s bookshelf.\nWhen Pratt joined Raiffa and Schlaifer to write Introduction to Statistical\nDecision Theory, he soon realized that what was easy for him to do\nmathematically was quite difficult for Schlaifer, who could understand the\nmathematics but not produce it himself. By the time the book was ready for\nediting, Schlaifer and Raiffa had moved on to other interests. They received\nso many requests for their preliminary manuscript, however, that McGraw-\nHill published it as a typescript in 1965. Thirty years later, Pratt and Raiffa\nfinished it, and MIT published it as an 875-page book.\nTo introduce business school professors to mathematical methods, Raiffa\nran an 11-month-long Ford Foundation program in 1960 and 1961.

There he pursued\nsocietal, rather than primarily statistical, issues in medicine, law,\nengineering, international relations, and public policy.\nBy any measure Raiffa\u2019s move was a success. As a pioneer in decision\nanalysis, he was one of four organizers of the Kennedy School of\nGovernment at Harvard; the founder and director of a joint East\u2013West think\ntank to reduce Cold War tensions long before perestroika; a founder of\nHarvard Law School\u2019s widely replicated role-playing course in negotiations;\nand scientific adviser to McGeorge Bundy, the national security assistant\nunder Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.

Pollsters classified people as\nRepublicans or Democrats; marketers divided consumers into users of one\ndetergent or another; scientists classified plants in biology and skulls in\nanthropology; and social scientists categorized individuals according to\npersonality.\nFinishing up with the Kinsey committee, Mosteller looked around for a\nresearch topic involving classification issues. He had a feet-on-the-ground\nattitude, perhaps the result of having been raised by his divorced mother,\nwho never graduated from high school but who had insisted, over the\nobjections of her ex-husband, that Fred get an education. Mosteller had\nearned his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in mathematics from Carnegie\nInstitute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh and\nenrolled in graduate statistics at Princeton University\u2019s highly abstract\nmathematics department.

The investigations of campaign\npolling and sexual research left him ripe for a problem of his own choosing.\nMosteller began looking around for a large database to use for developing\nways to discriminate between two cases. He began thinking\u2014not about\nBayes\u2019 rule\u2014but about a minor historical puzzle: The Federalist papers.\nBetween 1787 and 1788, three founding fathers of the United States,\nAlexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison, anonymously wrote 85\nnewspaper articles to persuade New York State voters to ratify the American\nConstitution. Historians could attribute most of the essays, but no one agreed\nwhether Madison or Hamilton had written 12 others.\nMosteller had learned about the problem during a summer job he held as a\ngraduate student in 1941.

When the summer\njob ended and the Second World War intervened, Mosteller forgot about The\nFederalist.\nAfter the war, he decided that The Federalist might fill the bill for his\nclassification project. By 1955 he was far enough along to rope in David L.\nWallace, a young statistician at the University of Chicago. In his disarmingly\ncasual way, Mosteller asked Wallace, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up and spend\nsome time in New England this summer, and work on this little project I\u2019ve\nsort of started?\u201d2 The two wound up spending more time studying The\nFederalist papers than Hamilton and Madison did writing them\u2014\u201ca horrible\nthought,\u201d Wallace said later.\nWallace urged Mosteller to use Bayes\u2019 rule for the project. Wallace had\nearned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton in 1953 and would become a\nprofessor at the University of Chicago. But in 1955, his first year at Chicago,\nSavage was teaching from his recently published book on Bayes\u2019 rule.\nDespite the hostility of most American statisticians, Wallace had been\nreceptive to Bayesian ideas.\nWallace thought The Federalist might be an application where Bayes\ncould be very helpful. \u201cIf you stick to relatively simple problems,\u201d he\nexplained, \u201clike the ones taught in elementary statistics books, you can do it\nby Bayesian or nonBayesian methods, and the answers are not appreciably\ndifferent.\u201d Laplace had investigated such problems in the early 1800s and\ndiscovered the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m not really a Bayesian,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t done much more than The Federalist, but . . . when you have large\nnumbers of parameters, of unknowns to deal with, the difference between\nBayes and non-Bayes grows immense.\u201d\nMosteller was open to suggestion. Unlike Savage, Lindley, Raiffa, and\nSchlaifer, he was no fervent Bayesian. He was an eclectic problem solver\nwho liked any technique that worked. He accepted the validity of both kinds\nof probability: probability as degrees of belief and probability as relative\nfrequency. The problem, as he saw it, was that treating a unique event like\n\u201cHamilton wrote paper No. 52\u201d was difficult with sampling theory.

In later years,\nwhen asked why he spent so much time on The Federalist papers, Mosteller\nwould point to \u201cthat Bayesian hothouse\u201d in the Harvard Business School and\nto the fact that Raiffa and Schlaifer did not deal with difficult problems or\ncomplex data. The discrepancy between too many Bayesian theories and too\nfew practical applications disturbed Mosteller.\nWith Savage\u2019s encouragement, Mosteller and Wallace started their quest to\n\u201capply a 200-year-old mathematical theorem to a 175-year-old historical\nproblem.\u201d In the process, Mosteller would organize the largest civilian\napplication of Bayes\u2019 rule since Laplace studied babies and Jeffreys\nanalyzed earthquakes. Not coincidentally, Wallace and Mosteller would\nresort to so-called high-speed computers.\nThey had seemingly vast amounts of data: 94,000 words definitely written\nby Hamilton and 114,000 by Madison. Of these, they would ignore\nsubstantive words like \u201cwar,\u201d \u201cexecutive,\u201d and \u201clegislature\u201d because their\nuse varied by essay topic.

The Federalist papers\nwould become a way to test Bayes\u2019 rule as a discrimination method.\nBy 1960 Wallace was working full-time on developing a Bayesian\nanalysis of The Federalist, working out the details for a mathematical model\nof their data. Given so many variables, Wallace and Mosteller would be\nmining the papers like low-grade ore, successively sifting, processing text in\nwaves, and discarding words of no help.

In-stead\nof using the mathematical vocabulary of probabilities, they adopted the\neveryday language of odds. They were expert mathematicians, but they found\nodds easier computationally and intuitively.\nDuring the decade it took to analyze The Federalist, Mosteller kept busy\non a number of fronts. His back-to-back investigations of the Truman election\nand the Kinsey report had turned him into the person to call when something\nwent wrong. Over the years Harvard would ask Mosteller to chair four\ndepartments: social relations (as acting chair); statistics (as its founder); and,\nin the university\u2019s School of Public Health, first biostatistics and then health\npolicy and management.\nHe persuaded Harvard (\u201cVERY SLOWLY,\u201d he wrote a friend)3 to\nestablish the statistics department. Joining the 1950s and 1960s push to apply\nmathematical models to social problems, he researched game theory,\ngambling, and learning, where Bayes\u2019 theorem itself was not used but served\nas a metaphor for thinking and accommodating new ideas. Eventually,\nMosteller\u2019s interest in those fields waned, and he moved on to other\npastures. Education remained a major interest. As part of the government\u2019s\npost-Sputnik push to teach students at every level about probability,\nMosteller wrote two textbooks about frequentism and Bayes\u2019 rule for high\nschool students. In 1961 he taught probability and statistics on NBC\u2019s early-\nmorning Continental Classroom series; his lectures were viewed by more\nthan a million people and taken for credit by 75,000. In medical research\nMosteller pioneered meta-analysis and strongly advocated randomized\nclinical trials, fair tests of medical treatments, and data-based medicine. He\nwas one of the first to conduct large-scale studies of placebo effects,\nevaluations of many medical centers, collaborations between physicians and\nstatisticians, and the use of large, mainframe computers.\nHow did Mosteller juggle a massive Bayesian analysis on top of his other\nwork? He looked tubby and rumpled, but he was a superb organizer and\nutterly unfazed by controversy. He was genial; he engaged critics with a\ntouch of humor, and he seemed to believe they were entitled to opinions he\ndisagreed with.

In truth, Mosteller collaborated only with people he\nconsidered worth his time, including Diaconis, John Tukey, the future U.S.\nsenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, economist Milton Friedman, and\nstatisticians like Savage. Finally, Mosteller credited his success to the fact\nthat \u201csomewhere along the road I got this new way of doing scholarly work\nin little groups of people.\u201d8 Colleagues and research assistants would divide\nup an interesting topic, meet every week or two, pass memos back and forth,\nand in four or five years publish a book. Working four or five such groups at\na time, Mosteller wrote or cowrote 57 books, 36 reports, and more than 360\npapers, including one with each of his children.\nFour years into The Federalist project, he and Wallace had a\nbreakthrough.

He greatly\nmissed a device he had enjoyed using at MIT: an overhead projector. He and\nWallace soon realized they would have to use computers. Harvard had no\ncomputer facilities of its own and relied on a cooperative arrangement with\nMIT. Mosteller and Wallace wound up using a substantial chunk of Harvard\u2019s\nallocation. Today, a desktop computer would be faster. Also slowing them\ndown was the fact that Fortran was only two years old, awkward, and hard to\nprogram for words. They were \u201cstraddling the introduction of the computer\nfor linguistic counts and the old hand-counting methods, with the\ndisadvantages of both.\u201d\nSubstituting student brawn for computer power, Mosteller organized an\narmy of 100 helpers\u201480 Harvard students plus 20 others. For several years,\nhis soldiers punched cards for the supposedly high-speed computer.\nProgramming proceeded so slowly that Youtz speeded up the search for\nmarker words by organizing a makeshift concordance by hand. Threading\nelectric typewriters with rolls of adding machine tape, students transcribed\none word to a line, cut the tape into strips with one word per strip, sorted\nthem alphabetically, and counted the strips. Once someone, forever unnamed,\nexhaled deeply and blew a cloud of statistical confetti. Within a few days,\nhowever, Youtz\u2019s typists discovered that Hamilton used \u201cupon\u201d twice per\npaper while Madison seldom used it at all.\nSoon thereafter, students punching computer cards found a fourth marker\nword, \u201cenough,\u201d also used by Hamilton but never by Madison. By now,\nMosteller had four words pointing to Madison as the author of the disputed\npapers. But here again, by editing one another\u2019s papers, Madison and\nHamilton could have melded their styles.

In preparation for Election Day, NBC went looking for someone to\nhelp it predict the winner. In the first of a series of surprises, the network\napproached a Princeton University professor, John W. Tukey.\nToday Tukey is best known for the terms \u201cbit\u201d and \u201csoftware,\u201d and few\noutside statistics and engineering recognize his name. But he was a man of\nstaggering accomplishments in the cloak-and-dagger world of military\nresearch, especially in code breaking and high-tech weaponry. He worked\ntwo jobs 30 miles apart: at Princeton University, where he was a professor\nof statistics, and at AT&T\u2019s Bell Laboratories, then widely considered the\nfinest industrial research laboratory in the world. From these vantage points,\nhe advised five successive U.S. presidents, the National Security Agency,\nand the Central Intelligence Agency.\nTo appreciate the audacity of NBC\u2019s job offer to Tukey, one needs to\nunderstand how deeply he was embedded in Cold War secrets. He had done\nresearch on topology in the late 1930s and military analysis in the 1940s. As\na young man during the Second World War, Tukey worked in Princeton with\nthe Operations Research Group that computed how a B-29 bomber speeding\nover Europe should aim its machine-gun fire. With pencil and paper during\nthe Cold War, he broad-brushed the aerodynamics, trajectory, and warhead\nfor the Nike, the first antiaircraft surface-to-air missile system. He also\nhelped persuade Eisenhower to build the U-2, the spy plane that flew from\n1956 until 1960, the year a U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down\nover the USSR.\nWhen NBC News approached Tukey in 1960, he had been a member of the\nCIA\u2019s Science and Technology Advisory Panel and the National Security\nAgency\u2019s Science Advisory Board for eight years. His most famous advisory\nrole had occurred the year before, when, as a delegate to the US\u2013USSR\nConference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests, he surprised the\nSoviet delegation by showing that seismogram data could distinguish\nunderground nuclear explosions from earthquakes. Once both sides knew\nthey could police each other\u2019s compliance, they signed the Partial Test Ban\nTreaty in 1963 to ban nuclear tests in the atmosphere, space, and sea.\nTukey also helped establish a super-secret cryptography think tank at\nPrinceton University. The communications research division of the Institute\nof Defense Analyses (IDA) moved into Von Neumann Hall, a new campus\nbuilding surrounded by an eight-foot-high brick wall.

Leslie R. Groves, asked\nthe Princeton physics chair Henry Smyth to write the official explanation of\nthe bomb, Atomic Energy for Military Purposes. In 1951 Princeton launched\na secret undertaking, Project Matterhorn, to design thermonuclear weapons at\nits nearby Forrestal Research Center. Tukey evaluated Edward Teller\u2019s and\nStanislaw Ulam\u2019s design for the first H-bomb early that year. According to\nhis curriculum vitae, Tukey served Forrestal Research Center as \u201csupervisor,\nMilitary Systems Analyst\u201d from 1951 until 1956.4 Physics professor John A.\nWheeler, who headed the weapons program, stated, \u201cI believe that the whole\ncountry\u2014scientifically, industrially, financially\u2014is better off because of him\nand bears evidence of his influence.\u201d5\nIn addition to his military research at Princeton, Tukey taught classes and\nsupervised more than 50 graduate students.

Only then did Tukey begin speaking. When a graduate\nstudent asked one January for an appointment to discuss his Ph.D. thesis,\nTukey checked his diary and said he was going to a meeting in two months\nand if the student drove him there they could talk about it in the car.\nTukey also advised the federal government on a wide range of civilian\nproblems: air quality, chemical pollution, ozone layer depletion, acid rain,\ncensus methodology, and educational testing.\nHow did he manage all this? Stories are legion about Tukey sitting in the\nback row at a seminar, dozing, reading mail, scanning newspapers, or editing\narticles, but then rising at the end of the talk to critique it. Tukey drafted\narticles in pencil while listening to baroque brass recordings, topped the\narticle with the words \u201cBy ____ and John W.

His nephew\nFrank R. Anscombe contended that Tukey had few wants, although they\nincluded a house near the sea, a convertible, a small catamaran, classical\nmusic recordings, and mince or apple pie. Tukey traveled with his personal\ntable tennis paddle; collected some 14,000 mystery, sci-fi, and adventure\npaperbacks; lunched on fistfuls of cheese and six glasses of skim milk; and\ndrove a 1936 wood-paneled station wagon until the passenger door fell off\nand his papers flew onto Nassau Street in Princeton.

First, the reputation of opinion surveys, the mainstay of social\nscience, was abysmal. Although sampling forms the foundation of statistics,\ncommercial pollsters were painfully slow to adopt probabilistic random\nsampling. Serving on the Kinsey Report study committee with Mosteller,\nTukey said he would prefer a random sample of three to a Kinsey sample of\n300; Kinsey\u2019s wife said she wanted to poison him. If Tukey aimed to\nimprove statistical practices in the polling industry, NBC News was a high-\nprofile place to start.\nSecond, NBC\u2019s RCA computers may have been a draw. If Tukey accepted\nNBC\u2019s offer, he would not need an army of students to snip pieces of adding\nmachine paper. RCA was a major military contractor as well as a giant in\ncommunications; it manufactured highly regarded mainframe computers for\nthe military and big business. During the 1940s the company\u2019s large research\nlaboratory had designed and built the Selectron memory tube for early\ncomputers, including von Neumann\u2019s Johnniac.\nThe opportunity to use RCA\u2019s computers to analyze election data must\nhave been tempting. Tukey had foreseen the intimate connection between\ncomputers and statistics years earlier. When von Neumann designed an\nelectronic computer for the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton in late\n1945, Tukey was the only Princeton University representative on the\ncommittee and helped design the computer\u2019s architecture and electronic\nadding circuit. Still, Tukey\u2019s \u201cmost striking relationship with the computer\nwas that he didn\u2019t use it\u201d; his hardware consisted of pencil and paper.9\nPolling reform and powerful computers, however, may have paled in\nimportance next to the allure of NBC\u2019s vast amounts of voting data. As an\nundergraduate at Brown University, Tukey had majored in chemistry with\ndoses of physics and geology, and his Ph.D. from Princeton, earned in 1939,\nwas in topology, among the purest branches of abstract mathematics. Military\nresearch during the Second World War turned him into a \u201cdata analyst\u201d\ncommitted to fighting the \u201cmental rigidity\u201d and \u201cossifications\u201d of pure\nmathematics and abstract statistics and to bridging the gap between\nmathematics and science.10 The war moved him far beyond the statistician\u2019s\nearly role as a passive observer.\nAfter the war Tukey decided he wanted to drive \u201cthe rocky road of real\nproblems in preference to the smooth road of unreal assumptions, arbitrary", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2556, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "236cb8d4-bc5a-4311-963f-d4f104b3f261": {"__data__": {"id_": "236cb8d4-bc5a-4311-963f-d4f104b3f261", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9ed15d9-58a7-4f4e-9e98-a7cbe9a225e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "ab324652c60a76701e674c47b4fa3dc50d32eaa5cc011117d41f5989ad596863", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "criteria, and abstract results without real attachments.\u201d11 To do so, he\naccepted joint positions a half hour apart at Princeton University and Bell\nLabs.

The\nrace between Kennedy and Nixon was the tightest since 1916, and Kennedy\nwould win by 120,000 votes out of 70 million cast. By 2:30 a.m., though,\nTukey and his colleagues were ready to call him the winner. The pressure\nwas too much for NBC. Network executives hustled the statisticians into a\nroom without telephones, locked them in and refused to let them out until 8\na.m. Tukey and his team twiddled their thumbs all night, unable to release\ntheir results until morning, when it was clear Kennedy had won. Still, Tukey\nhad prevented NBC from mistakenly declaring Nixon the winner. Relieved\nand impressed, the network asked him to assemble a team for the\ncongressional election in 1962. He would work for NBC News for 18 years.\nTukey\u2019s handpicked group eventually included ENIAC coinventor John\nMauchly; Cornfield of NIH; Richard F. Link, Tukey\u2019s first graduate student\nand pollster Louis Harris\u2019s chief statistician; Yale psychology professor\nRobert Abelson; and David Brillinger, later a professor of statistics at\nBerkeley. When David Wallace finished Mosteller\u2019s analysis of The\nFederalist papers, he too joined the group.\nWallace arrived expecting a vacation from Bayes\u2019 rule because Tukey was\nthought to look down on it. Tukey is not known to have ever published\nanything using Bayes\u2019 rule, and in an often-quoted remark, he said, \u201cThere\nare many classes of problems where Bayesian analyses are reasonable,\nmainly classes with which I have little acquaintance.\u201d14 Among those were\nbusiness decision making, the bailiwick of Howard Raiffa and Robert\nSchlaifer.

Said Fienberg,\nNBC polling used \u201ca form of empirical Bayes, where the past results were\nused to construct the prior distribution.\u201d16\nNevertheless, in almost two decades of election forecasting Tukey never\nadmitted to using Bayes\u2019 rule. Why would someone who publicly disdained\nBayes\u2019 rule and seemed to look down on it use it for something as important\nas announcing the next president of the United States?\nMany colleagues stress that, despite appearances, Tukey was \u201ca very\nprivate man.\u201d His nephew called him an \u201celliptical and enigmatic Delphic\nOracle in a black polo shirt.\u201d Wallace agreed: \u201cTukey could be close-\nmouthed. . . .

While George Box was\ngiving a seminar at Princeton University, Tukey thought he knew what Box\nwas going to say and kept chiming in with his own commentary. Box finally\nasked for a show of hands. Who wanted Tukey to continue interrupting, and\nwho wanted him to stop? When Box won, Tukey looked surprised. \u201cIn some\nways, he was a very clever eight-year-old,\u201d Box recalled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem\nto understand very much about interpersonal relations.\u201d Some colleagues\npointed to his early years as a child prodigy home-schooled by his mother\nand said that his wife, Elizabeth, helped \u201cwarm him up.\u201d Edgar Gilbert from\nBell Labs concluded, \u201cHe was a very likeable personality but he was hard to\nunderstand.\u201d Peter McCullagh, an Irish statistician at the University of\nChicago, called him a \u201cconstructive scientific anarchist, . . . a cultural\nphenomenon, revered by some, feared by others, understood by few.\u201d Part of\nthe problem, Pratt said, was that \u201cTukey could argue on both sides of\nanything, and you didn\u2019t know where he stood.\u201d18", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2519, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ef96a1a-d83a-4c1c-adfe-e13110a3a0af": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ef96a1a-d83a-4c1c-adfe-e13110a3a0af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "585bd3a4-4398-4baf-b71e-ac51420a58cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "c301885a1947d264efe52c37aba0970a55b8c1e07f83aaf1ea1ff38a9a38a1e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Adding to the confusion was Tukey\u2019s acceptance of one of Savage\u2019s most\ncontroversial tenets: subjectivity.

Almost invariably, when closely inspected, data are\nfound to violate [the] standard assumptions\u201d required by frequency. \u201cFar\nbetter an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague,\nthan an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made\nprecise.\u201d Tukey publicized how even slight deviations from the normal\nmodel could muddle the methods of Fisher, Neyman, and Egon Pearson.

He named his\napproach exploratory data analysis (EDA). Like Bayesians, many of its\nproponents were ridiculed and had trouble finding jobs.\nSo how did Tukey resolve his paradoxical use of Bayes\u2019 rule without\nadmitting it? He called it something else.

In one\narticle, Mosteller had difficulty talking him out of using musical notation\u2014\nsharps, flats, and naturals. Another colleague threatened to call him J. W.\nCutie for terms such as \u201csaphe cracking,\u201d \u201cquefrency,\u201d and \u201calanysis.\u201d As\nWallace said, \u201cIt was not always the best way to win friends and influence\npeople. . . . But when I talked to Tukey, I essentially tried to use his\nterminology.\u201d\nStill, Bayes\u2019 rule by any other name is Bayes\u2019 rule. And both Tukey and\nMosteller were willing to use whatever statistical tool was needed, even if it\nwas Bayesian. Beginning work long before Election Day, Wallace built a\nbase of initial information by combining data from preelection polls;\nnonstatistical, expert opinion from political scientists; and the voting\nhistories of precincts, counties, cities, and states.

I\u2019m not in a position to speak of that but I. J. Good is the\nprincipal contributor to the Bayesian group and he was taking that\nposition.\u201d29 Good was Alan Turing\u2019s cryptographic assistant during the\nSecond World War. So did Tukey use Bayes\u2019 rule for decoding for the\nNational Security Agency? And could he have been distancing himself from\nBayesian methods in order to protect work there?\nThe ties between Tukey, Bayes, and top-secret decoding are many and\nclose. Bayes\u2019 rule is a natural for decoders who have some initial guesses\nand must minimize the time or cost to reach a solution; it has been widely\nused for decoding ever since Bletchley Park. Tukey\u2019s ties to American\ncryptography were particularly tight. According to William O. Baker, then\nhead of Bell Labs, Tukey was part of the force that helped decrypt Germany\u2019s\nEnigma system during the Second World War and Soviet codes during the\nCold War. Tukey served on NSA\u2019s Science Advisory Board, which was\ndevoted to cryptography. It was a ten-member panel of scientists from\nuniversities, corporate research laboratories, and think tanks; they met twice\nyearly at Fort Meade, Maryland, to discuss the application of science and\ntechnology to code breaking, cryptography, and eavesdropping. Baker,\nTukey\u2019s close friend, was probably the committee\u2019s most important member.\nBaker chaired a long study of America\u2019s coding and decoding resources for\nthe NSA and called for a Manhattan Project\u2013like effort to focus, not on\npublishable and freely available research, but on top-secret studies.

Berger became a Bayesian in the 1970s, the community\nwas still so small he could track virtually all of its activity. The first\ninternational conference on Bayes\u2019 rule was held in 1979, in Valencia, Spain,\nand almost every well-known Bayesian showed up\u2014perhaps 100 in all.\nGone was the messianic dream that Bayes\u2019 rule could replace frequentism.\nEcumenical pragmatists spoke of synthesizing Bayesian and nonBayesian\nmethods. The least controversial ideal, Mosteller and Tukey agreed, was\neither a frequency-based prior or a \u201cgentle\u201d prior based on beliefs but ready\nto be overwhelmed by new information.\nWhen Box, J. Stuart Hunter, and William G. Hunter wrote Statistics for\nExperimenters in 1978, they intentionally omitted any reference to Bayes\u2019\nrule: too controversial to sell. Shorn of the big bad word, the book was a\nbestseller. Ironically, an Oxford philosopher, Richard Swinburne, felt no\nsuch compunctions a year later: he inserted personal opinions into both the\nprior hunch and the supposedly objective data of Bayes\u2019 theorem to conclude\nthat God was more than 50% likely to exist; later Swinburne would figure the\nprobability of Jesus\u2019 resurrection at \u201csomething like 97 percent.\u201d These were\ncalculations that neither the Reverend Thomas Bayes nor the Reverend\nRichard Price had cared to make, and even many nonstatisticians regarded\nSwinburne\u2019s lack of careful measurement as a black mark against Bayes\nitself.\nThroughout this period Jerzy Neyman\u2019s bastion of frequentism at Berkeley\nremained the premiere statistical center of the United States. Stanford\u2019s large\nstatistics department, bolstered by Charles Stein and other University of\nCalifornia professors who had refused to sign a McCarthy-era loyalty oath,\nwas also enthusiastically frequentist, and anti-Bayesian signs adorned\nprofessors\u2019 office doors.\nBayesians were treading water. Almost without knowing it they were\nwaiting until computers could catch up. In the absence of powerful and\naccessible computers and software, many Bayesians and anti-Bayesians alike\nhad given up attempts at realistic applications and retreated into theoretical\nmathematics.

Then you can justify it whichever way you like.\u201d2\nWithin Bayesian circles, opinions were still defended passionately.\nAttending his first Bayesian conference in 1976, Jim Berger was shocked to\nsee half the room yelling at the other half. Everyone seemed to be good\nfriends, but their priors were split between the personally subjective, like\nSavage\u2019s, and the objective, like Jeffreys\u2019s\u2014with no definitive experiment to\ndecide the issue.

Consequently, when the U.S. Congress commissioned the first\ncomprehensive study of nuclear power plant safety, the question arose:\nwould anyone dare mention Bayes by name, much less actually use Bayes\u2019\nrule?\nPresident Eisenhower had launched the nuclear power industry with his\nAtoms for Peace speech in 1953. Twenty years later, although no\ncomprehensive study of safety risks to the public or the environment had been\nmade, private corporations owned and operated 50 nuclear power plants in\nthe United States. When Congress began debating whether to absolve plant\nowners and operators of all liability for accidents, the U.S. Atomic Energy\nCommission finally ordered a safety study.\nSignificantly, as it turned out, the man appointed to lead the study was not\na statistician but a physicist and engineer. Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,\nin 1927, Norman Carl Rasmussen had served a year in the navy after the\nSecond World War, graduated from Gettysburg College in 1950, and earned a\nPh.D. in experimental low-energy nuclear physics at MIT in 1956. He taught\nphysics there until MIT formed one of the first departments of nuclear\nengineering, in 1958.\nWhen Rasmussen was appointed to assess the safety of the nuclear power\nindustry, there had never been a nuclear plant accident. Believing that any\nsuch accident would be catastrophic, engineers designed the plants\nconservatively, and the government regulated them tightly.\nLacking any data about core melts, Rasmussen decided to do as Madansky\nhad done at RAND when studying H-bomb accidents. He and his coauthors\nwould deal with the failure rates of pumps, valves, and other equipment.\nWhen these failure rates did not produce enough statistics either, the\nRasmussen group turned to a politically incendiary source of information:\nexpert opinion and Bayesian analysis.\nEngineers had long relied on professional judgment, but frequentists\nconsidered it subjective and not reproducible and banned its use.

But Rasmussen\u2019s panel already had enough controversy on its hands\ndealing with nuclear power. The last thing they needed was an argument over\nmethods.\nTo avoid using Bayes\u2019 equation, they employed Raiffa\u2019s decision trees.\nRaiffa was a Bayesian missionary, and his trees had Bayesian roots, but that\ndid not matter. Panel members avoided even the words \u201cBayes\u2019 rule\u201d; they\ncalled it a subjectivistic approach.

This was the first\naccident involving the widespread dispersal of radioactive material and the\nfirst that attracted widespread, highly critical scrutiny from the world\u2019s\nmedia. Within three days, reporters in Palomares knew that a nuclear bomb\nwas missing, but six weeks passed before the U.S. Department of Defense\nwould confirm it. Censorship by Spain\u2019s dictator, Francisco Franco, kept\nnews of the radioactivity off local radio stations, while broadcasts from\nCommunist Eastern Europe spread the word. Radio Moscow announced that\n\u201cthe bomb is still in the sea, irradiating the water and the fish,\u201d and the\nSoviet government complained that the United States had broken the nuclear\ntest-ban treaty of 1963.

President\nJohnson phoned the Department of Defense every day demanding news on the\nsearch.\nArriving in this hotbed of tension, Captain Andrews immediately\nintroduced Richardson to RAdm. William S. Guest, commander of the navy\ntask force looking for the bomb. Guest was celebrated as the first U.S.\naircraft carrier pilot to sink an enemy ship during the Second World War.

The entire search, called Aircraft Salvops Med,\nwould cost \n 12 million in 1966 dollars.\nGuest wanted to save money by using the equipment where it was best\nsuited and then returning it as soon as possible. This meant he wanted to\nsearch some areas that were actually unlikely sites for the H-bomb.\nCraven\u2019s initial hypotheses were based on prevailing winds, so the early\nhunt focused on a large rectangular area called Alpha II off the beach of\nPalomares. Guest ordered his swimmers, divers, and minesweepers to\nsearch there over and over again.\nRichardson began work immediately by combing the charts of the search to\ndate. The first weakness he saw was that, although there were tracks of\nwhere the ships had gone back and forth, there was no mention of\neffectiveness. \u201cJust going back and forth wouldn\u2019t do you much good if you\ncouldn\u2019t see the bottom of the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that in fact was the case.\nSome of their sensors couldn\u2019t penetrate deep water, so they were basically\nout there running around but not contributing anything to the effectiveness of\nthe search. . . .

Mooney,\nlater promoted to commander and chief of naval research, came from New\nHampshire, where lobstermen used similar methods to find their submerged\npots.

When Orts twice pointed\nminesweepers to the same spot in the Mediterranean, Moony believed him.\nSoon Orts\u2019s testimony formed the basis for a high-likelihood hypothesis:\nwith one parachute deployed, the bomb had plunged into a steep, deep-water\ncanyon filled with tailings from an old lead mine. Mooney drew a one-mile\nradius around Orts\u2019s spot and named it Alpha I.\nAs Craven recalled, \u201cWe didn\u2019t find the bomb for a long period of time\nbecause the place of highest probability is a place we can\u2019t get to.

The H-bomb hunt was a striking\ndemonstration of how difficult it would be to win operational support for\nBayes\u2019 rule, even when something as tangible and terrifying as a missing\nthermonuclear bomb was concerned.\nStill, although Bayesian updating was not used at Palomares, the success\nof the search strengthened Craven\u2019s faith in scientific searches and the\npotential of Bayes\u2019 rule. He and his team had learned how to compute\nsubjective presearch hypotheses and weight their importance. They realized\nthat the future of Bayesian search methods depended crucially on computer\npower and the portability of computerized information. This was not an\ninsignificant realization.

Thanks to Craven, the investigation\ntook a spectacular leap forward.\nCraven organized a full-blown Bayesian hunt for Scorpion from the very\nbeginning. When the H-bomb was lost off the Spanish coast, Craven had\nturned almost accidentally to Bayes in the hope of deflecting Congressional\ndispleasure in case of failure. This time, the navy moved tentatively but with\ngrowing faith to exploit the method.\n\u201cCraven had confidence in the scientific approach from the very beginning\nbut, to put it mildly, that wasn\u2019t everybody\u2019s thing,\u201d Richardson said.\n\u201cTough\u201d is the word most often used to describe Craven, and for the next five\nmonths, from June to October 1968, he staunchly defended Bayes against\nskeptics.

A powerful computer in the United States would\ncompute the probabilities of the various presearch hypotheses. Then this\nprior was to be combined and updated on shipboard with daily search\nresults.\nShortly after the sub disappeared, Richardson was flown to the Azores to\nobserve the surface search for Scorpion and to visit the USNS Mizar, a\nresearch ship conducting underwater operations. Personnel from the Naval\nResearch Laboratory, the Navy Oceanographic Office, and various\nequipment makers were aboard the Mizar, working 12-hour shifts around the\nclock.

The dice in this case\nis a random number generator in the computer. You roll the dice and pick a\nscenario to work with. Then you roll the dice for a certain speed, and you\nroll the dice again to see what direction it took. The last thing is that it\ncollided with the bottom at an unknown time so you roll dice for the unknown\ntime. So now you have speed, direction, starting point, time. Given them all, I\nknow precisely where it [could have] hit the bottom. You have the computer\nput a point there. Rolling dice, I come up with different factors for each\nscenario.

Until the target is found, every\nday represents a failure. As Stone put it, \u201cBayes says that the longer you\nsearch without finding the target, the worse your prospects are, because the\nremaining time to detect the target gets longer, not shorter.\u201d13 On the other\nhand, those with confidence in Bayes\u2019 rule could trace their progress. \u201cAreas\nthat you search go down in probability,\u201d Richardson explained, \u201cand areas\nthat you haven\u2019t searched go up. So your updated probabilities get higher\nwhere you haven\u2019t been looking. . . . And generally, it\u2019s always most optimal\nto keep looking in the highest probability area.

By this time Craven had organized acoustical studies to more\nprecisely calibrate the location of the blip recorded by the supersecret\nsensors. Small depth charges were exploded in the ocean at precisely known\npositions, and their sounds were used to refine the information recorded by\nnaval listening posts during the Scorpion\u2019s last moments. Every day Craven\u2019s\nacoustical analyses edged the most likely spot for the Scorpion closer to\nBuchanan\u2019s shining piece of metal.\nIn late October the increasingly impatient and by now heavily bearded\nBuchanan finally got approval to investigate the shiny metal. As Mizar\u2019s sled\nmade its 74th run over the ocean floor, its magnetometer spiked high at\nseveral anomalies in cell F6. Returning to the area on October 28, Mizar\nstruggled to pinpoint the spot again. Finally its cameras revealed, lying on the\nsea bottom, partially buried in sand, the submarine Scorpion. A poorly\nfunctioning sonar detector had previously passed right over the sub without\nfinding it.

The\nscrap was later determined to be a Scorpion fragment. Still, Richardson\njoked ruefully, 260 yards off in a 140-square mile area of open sea was\n\u201cclose enough for government work.\u201d\nYears later, Captain Andrews argued that Bayes was only one day and a\nhalf mile behind Buchanan. If Buchanan had not returned the Mizar to the\nshiny metal that day, Craven\u2019s presearch probabilities, updated with his later\nacoustical studies, would have found Scorpion first.\nOn November 1, five months after the search began, Rosenberg, the co-op\nstudent from Drexel, hand-carried the photos of Scorpion back to the United\nStates.

If Scorpion had fired a\ndefective torpedo, it would have missed its target and probably turned back\nand struck the sub that had launched it.\nAnxious to document the methods used in the search for Scorpion, the\nOffice of Naval Research commissioned Stone to write Theory of Optimal\nSearch. Published in 1975, it is an unabashedly Bayesian book incorporating\napplied mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization theory, and\ncomputer programs. Cheaper and more powerful computers were\ntransforming Bayesian searches from mathematical and analytical problems\nto algorithms for software programs. Stone\u2019s book became a classic,\nimportant for the military, the Coast Guard, fishermen, police, oil explorers,\nand others.\nWhile Stone was writing his book, the United States agreed to help Egypt\nclear the Suez Canal of unexploded ammunition from the Yom Kippur war\nwith Israel in 1973. The explosives made dredging dangerous.

In\nthe end, no one talked about Bayes at Suez.\nUp to this point, postwar Bayes had searched only for stationary objects like\nbombs in a canal, or H-bombs and submarines on the ocean floor.\nTechnically, these were simple problems. But shortly after the Suez Canal\nwas cleared and Theory of Optimal Search was published, intensive efforts\nwere made to adapt Bayesian methods to moving targets: civilian boats adrift\nin predictable currents and winds.\nThe technology was a perfect match for U.S. Coast Guard rescue\ncoordinators like Joseph Discenza, whose job in the late 1960s was to\nanswer the telephone when someone called saying, \u201cMy husband went out\nfishing with my son, and they\u2019re not back.\u201d15 After checking area ports of call\nfor the boat, he used a Coast Guard Search and Rescue Manual to estimate by\nhand the target\u2019s location and its probable drift.\n\u201cLike a dog with a bone in his teeth,\u201d Discenza started to computerize the\nCoast Guard\u2019s manual.16 He studied search theory and earned a master\u2019s\ndegree at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and a Ph.D.\nat New York University. Along the way Discenza discovered that ever since\nthe Second World War the Coast Guard had been using the Bayesian search\ntheory developed by Koopman to find U-boats in the open ocean. Discenza\nfilled in the corporate memory gap between the 1940s and the 1970s. \u201cThe\nCoast Guard was very Bayesian. Even when they\u2019re doing it manually,\nthey\u2019re doing Bayes,\u201d Stone said. But until Discenza, they were like early\ncasualty actuaries, using Bayes\u2019 rule without realizing it.\nJoining forces with Discenza, Wagner\u2019s company designed a computerized\nsearch system based on Bayesian principles for the Coast Guard. A natural\noutgrowth of the H-bomb and Scorpion searches, it combined clues about a\nvessel\u2019s original location and subsequent movements into a series of self-\nconsistent scenarios and then weighted them as to their likelihood.\nThe Coast Guard ruled that estimating probabilities and weights should be\na group decision. Each individual involved should weight the scenarios\nprivately before they were averaged or combined by consensus. Above all,\nno scenario should be discarded. \u201cTo leave out subjective information is to\nthrow away valuable information because there is no unique or \u2018scientific\u2019\nway to quantify it,\u201d Stone urged.17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2413, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6ddcefc-4f14-4e0a-9f8e-98183f2d510d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6ddcefc-4f14-4e0a-9f8e-98183f2d510d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae44c845-acce-4f68-808b-018e3598c329", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "394c5ccffe2edff531985487e274f5591d1c244afefc9ae5231c786ace253458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "What if a ship in distress radioed its position but a small plane reported\nseeing it an hour later a hundred miles away?

The technique did not become popular among academics until\nthe 1990s, but it saved military and space contractors immense amounts of\ntime in the 1960s because their computers had little memory or power.\nBefore Rudolf E. Kalman and Richard Bucy invented the procedure in 1961,\neach original observation had to be completely recalculated every time a\nnew one appeared; with the filter, new observations could be added without\nhaving to do everything all over again. Kalman vehemently denied that\nBayes\u2019 theorem had anything to do with his invention, but Masanao Aoki\nproved mathematically in 1967 that it can be derived directly from Bayes\u2019\nrule. Today, it is known as a Kalman or a Kalman-Bucy filter.\nOnce Monte Carlo methods and filters were adopted, even untenable and\nhighly improbable paths produced valuable information and helped searchers\ndetermine which of the remaining paths were more likely. As more\ninformation arrived from sensors, Coast Guard aircraft, weather reports, tide\ntables, and charts of prevailing currents and winds, the data were converted\ninto likelihood functions and then combined with priors about the target\u2019s\nmovements to predict its probable location. As data accumulated with each\niteration, the filter concentrated a relatively small number of highly probable\npaths.\nThe Coast Guard\u2019s system was up and running in 1974 when a tuna boat\nsank off Long Beach, California.

Consequently, it was the air force that sponsored a review in\n1983 of NASA\u2019s estimates of the probability of a shuttle failure. The\ncontractor, Teledyne Energy Systems, employed a Bayesian analysis using\nthe prior experience of 32 confirmed failures during 1,902 rocket motor\nlaunches. Using \u201csubjective probabilities and operating experience,\u201d\nTeledyne estimated the probability of a rocket booster failure at 1 in 35;\nNASA\u2019s estimate at the time was 1 in 100,000. Teledyne, however, insisted\nthat \u201cthe prudent approach is to rely on conservative failure estimates based\non prior experience and probabilistic analysis.\u201d3 On January 28, 1986,\nduring the shuttle\u2019s twenty-fifth launch, the Challenger exploded, killing all\nseven crew members aboard.\nThe disparity between the military\u2019s sometime acceptance of Bayes and the\nacademic statistical community\u2019s refusal to embrace it is still puzzling. Did\nthe military\u2019s top-secret experience with Bayes during the Second World War\nand the Cold War give it confidence in the method? Was the military less\nafraid of using computers? Or did it simply have easier access to powerful\nones? Given that many sources dealing with the Second World War and the\nCold War are still classified, we may never know the answers to these\nquestions.\nSeveral civilian researchers tackling hitherto intractable problems\nconcerning public health, sociology, epidemiology, and image restoration did\nexperiment during the 1980s with computers for Bayes. A major controversy\nabout the effect of diesel engine emissions on air quality and cancer inspired\nthe first attempt. By the 1980s cancer specialists had solid data about the\neffects of cigarette smoke on people, laboratory animals, and cells but little\naccurate information about diesel fumes. William H.

Harris was not a\nstatistician and did not care what method he used as long as it answered the\nquestion. Adopting hierarchical Bayes, they borrowed information from\nlaboratory tests on mice, hamster embryo cells, and chemical substances.\nThey even incorporated experts\u2019 opinions about the biological relevance of\nnonhumans to humans and of cigarette to diesel smoke. Bayes let them\naccount formally for their uncertainties about combining information across\nspecies.\nMicrocomputers were not widely available. Many of the researchers\nstudying the new acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic,\nfor example, were making statistical calculations by hand, and mathematical\nshortcuts were still being published for them.

Previous\nresearchers had used frequency techniques to show that coal mining accident\nrates had changed over time. They assumed, however, that the change had\nbeen gradual. Raftery wanted to check whether it had been gradual or abrupt.\nFirst, he developed some heavy frequentist mathematics for analyzing the\ndata.

And in doing so he\ndiscovered a remarkable, hitherto unknown event in British history. Raftery\u2019s\nBayesian analysis revealed that accident rates plummeted suddenly in the late\n1880s or early 1890s. A historian friend suggested why. In 1889, British\nminers had formed the militant Miners\u2019 Federation (which later became the\nNational Union of Mine Workers). Safety was their number one issue. Almost\novernight, coal mines got safer.\n\u201cIt was a Eureka moment,\u201d Raftery said. \u201cIt was quite a thrill. And without\nBayesian statistics, it would have been much harder to do a test of this\nhypothesis.\u201d5 Frequency-based statistics worked well when one hypothesis\nwas a special case of the other and both assumed gradual behavior. But when\nhypotheses were competing and neither was a special case of the other,\nfrequentism was not as helpful, especially with data involving abrupt\nchanges\u2014like the formation of a militant union.\nRaftery wound up publishing two papers in 1986 about modeling abrupt\nrate changes. His first, frequentist paper was long, dense, and virtually\nunread. His second, Bayesian paper was shorter, simpler, and had a much\ngreater impact. Raftery\u2019s third 1986 paper ran just 1-1/4 pages and had an\nimmediate effect on sociologists. The article appeared just as many\nsociologists were about to give up on frequentism\u2019s controversial p-values.\nA typical sociologist might work with data sets about thousands of\nindividuals, each with hundreds of variables such as age, race, religion,\nclimate, and family structure. Unfortunately, when researchers tried to\ndetermine the relevance of those variables using frequentist methods\ndeveloped by Karl Pearson and R. A. Fisher for 50 to 200 cases, the results\nwere often bizarre. Obscure effects became important, or went in opposite\ndirections, or were disproved by later studies. By selecting a single model\nfor large samples, frequentists ignored uncertainties about the model. Yet few\nsocial scientists could repeat their surveys or rerun experiments under\nprecisely the same conditions. By the early 1980s many sociologists had\nconcluded that, for testing hypotheses, their intuition was more accurate than\nfrequentism.\nBayes, on the other hand, seemed to produce results that corresponded\nmore closely to sociologists\u2019 intuition. Raftery told his colleagues, \u201cThe\npoint is that we should be comparing the models, not just looking for\npossibly minor discrepancies between one of them and the data.\u201d6\nResearchers really want to know which of their models is more likely to be", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2584, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bed782de-d1ca-4f48-8107-77400a8fcbfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bed782de-d1ca-4f48-8107-77400a8fcbfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "247", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20120edd-c366-4768-bdbb-27c8b492fd6c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "247", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "a5ea5bdc60f8539e129440de4a51adf06e5847ad7d12ac0a17f94d07e2242144", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "true, given the data.

Bayesian hypothesis\ntesting swept sociology and demography, and Raftery\u2019s short paper is still\namong the most cited in sociology.\nMeanwhile, image processing and analysis had become critically\nimportant for the military, industrial automation, and medical diagnosis.\nBlurry, distorted, imperfect images were coming from military aircraft,\ninfrared sensors, ultrasound machines, photon emission tomography,\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, electron micrographs, and\nastronomical telescopes. All these images needed signal processing, noise\nremoval, and deblurring to make them recognizable. All were inverse\nproblems ripe for Bayesian analysis.\nThe first known attempt to use Bayes to process and restore images\ninvolved nuclear weapons testing at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Bobby\nR. Hunt suggested Bayes to the laboratory and used it in 1973 and 1974. The\nwork was classified, but during this period he and Harry C. Andrews wrote\na book, Digital Image Restoration, about the basic methodology; the\nlaboratory declassified the book and approved its publication in 1976. The\nU.S. Congress retained Hunt in 1977 and 1978 to analyze images of the\nshooting of President Kennedy. In his testimony, Hunt did not refer to Bayes.\n\u201cToo technical for a Congressional hearing,\u201d he said later.\nAt almost the same time that Hunt was working on image analysis for the\nmilitary, Julian Besag at the University of Durham in England was using\ndiseased tomato plants to study the spread of epidemics. Bayes helped him\ndiscern local regularities and neighborly interactions among plants growing\nin pixel-like lattice systems. Looking at one pixel, Besag realized he could\nestimate the probability that its neighbor might share the same color, a useful\ntool for image enhancement. But Besag was not a card-carrying Bayesian,\nand his work went largely unnoticed at the time.\nA group of researchers with Ulf Grenander at Brown University was\ntrying to design mathematical models for medical imaging by exploring the\neffect one pixel could have on a few of its neighbors.

Stuart had majored in physics as an undergraduate and\nknew about Monte Carlo sampling techniques. So the Geman brothers\ninvented a variant of Monte Carlo that was particularly suited to imaging\nproblems with lots of pixels and lattices.\nSitting at a table in Paris, Donald Geman thought about naming their\nsystem.

Working at pixel levels\non a 64 x 64-cell fragment of a photo, they produced too many unknowns for\ncomputers of the day to digest. They wrote up their sampler in a formidably\ndifficult paper and published it in 1984 in IEEE Transactions on Pattern\nAnalysis and Machine Intelligence. Specialists in image processing, neural\nnetworks, and expert systems quickly adopted the method, which, with\ncomputers gaining more power every year, also sparked the interest of some\nstatisticians. The brothers spent the next year racing around the globe giving\ninvited talks.\nDonald Geman used the Gibbs sampler to improve satellite images; Stuart\nused it for medical scans. Several years later, statisticians outside the small\nspatial imaging community began to realize that more general versions could\nbe useful. The Gibbs sampler\u2019s flexibility and reliability would make it the\nmost popular Monte Carlo algorithm.

The\nminute Gelfand saw the Gemans\u2019 paper, the pieces came together: Bayes,\nGibbs sampling, Markov chains, and iterations. A Markov chain can be\ncomposed of scores of links, and for each one a range of possible variables\nmust be sampled and calculated one after another. Anyone studying a rare and\nsubtle effect must compute each chain over and over again to get a big enough\nnumber to reveal the rarity. The numbers involved become enormous, and the\nlength and tediousness of the calculations turned off most researchers.\nBut Gelfand and Smith saw that replacing difficult integration with\nsampling would be a wonderful computational tool for Bayesians. \u201cIt went\nback to the most basic things you learn in an introductory statistics course,\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2596, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd902f2f-7b0e-46f0-b509-b1f16ff5c891": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd902f2f-7b0e-46f0-b509-b1f16ff5c891", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc66b734-caa6-481c-ab01-49baf1bc726e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "7650562408095d5584d8b79969431ef5aa329c3d787e770d67002a90d3b27218", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gelfand explained. \u201cIf you want to learn about a distribution or a population,\nyou take samples from it.

To illustrate\nthis puzzling lapse, some flashbacks are required. Monte Carlo began in\n1906, when Andrei Andreyevich Markov, a Russian mathematician, invented\nMarkov chains of variables. The calculations took so long, though, that\nMarkov himself applied his chains only to the vowels and consonants in a\nPushkin poem.\nThirty years later, with the beginning of nuclear physics in the 1930s, the\nItalian physicist Enrico Fermi was studying neutrons in collision reactions.\nFermi fought insomnia by computing Markov chains in his head to describe\nthe paths of neutrons in collision reactions. To the surprise of his colleagues\nthe next morning, Fermi could predict their experimental results. With a small\nmechanical adding machine, Fermi built Markov chains to solve other\nproblems too.

To calculate the\ncritical mass of neutrons needed to make a thermonuclear explosion, Maria\nGoeppert Mayer, a future Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist, simulated the\nprocess with Markov chains, following one neutron at a time and making\ndecisions at various places as to whether the neutron was most likely to get\nabsorbed, escape, die, or fission.

Working on early computers with between 400 and 80,000\nbytes of memory, they dealt with memory losses, unreadable tapes, failed\nvacuum tubes, and programming in assembly language.

The legal take by native\nhunters was roughly 87 whales a year. Frequentist methods would have\nrequired seven years of data collection to assess whether this catch was\nsustainable.

In contrast, Bayesian purists like Michael I. Jordan of\nBerkeley and Philip Dawid of Cambridge object to the term \u201cBayesian\nnetworks\u201d; they regard Judea Pearl\u2019s nomenclature as a misnomer because\nBayesian networks do not always have priors and Bayes without priors is not\nBayes. But Koller insists that her networks fully qualify as Bayesian because\nshe carefully constructs priors for their variables.\nKoller\u2019s fascination with uncertainty has led her from genetics to imaging\nand robotics. Images typically have variable and ambiguous features that are\nembedded in background clutter. The human visual system sends ten million\nsignals per second to the brain, where a billion neurons strip off random\nfluctuations and irrelevant, ambiguous information to reveal shape, color,\ntexture, shading, surface reflections, roughness, and other features. As a\nresult, human beings can look at a blurry, distorted, noisy pattern and\ninstantly recognize a tomato plant, a car, or a sheep. Yet a state-of-the-art\ncomputer trained to recognize cars and sheep may picture only nonsensical\nrectangles. The difference is that the human brain has prior knowledge to\nintegrate with the new images.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling,\u201d says Koller. The problem is not computer hardware;\nit is writing the software. \u201cA computer can easily be trained to distinguish a\ndesert from a forest, but where the road is and where it\u2019s about to fall off a\ncliff, that\u2019s much harder.\u201d\nTo explore such imaging problems, Sebastian Thrun of Stanford built a\ndriverless car named Stanley. The Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) staged a contest with a \n 2 million prize for the best\ndriverless car; the military wants to employ robots instead of manned\nvehicles in combat. In a watershed for robotics, Stanley won the competition\nin 2005 by crossing 132 miles of Nevada desert in seven hours.\nWhile Stanley cruised along at 35 mph, its camera took images of the route\nand its computer estimated the probability of various obstacles.

As\npart of this endeavor, linguists like Noam Chomsky developed structural\nrules for English sentences, subjects, verbs, adjectives, and grammar but\nfailed to produce an algorithm that could explain why one string of words\nmakes an English sentence while another string does not.\nDuring the 1970s IBM had two competing teams working on a similar\nproblem, speech recognition. One group, filled with linguists, studied the\nrules of grammar. The other group, led by Mercer and Brown, who later went\nto RenTech, was filled with mathematically inclined communications\nspecialists, computer scientists, and engineers. They took a different tack,\nreplaced logical grammar with Bayes\u2019 rule, and were ignored for a decade.\nMercer\u2019s ambition was to make computers do intelligent things, and voice\nrecognition seemed to be the way to make this happen. For both Mercer and\nBrown speech recognition was a problem about taking a signal that had\npassed through a noisy channel like a telephone and then determining the\nmost probable sentence that the speaker had in mind. Ignoring grammar rules,\nthey decided to figure out the statistical probability that words and phrases in\none language would wind up as particular words or phrases in another. They\ndid not have to know any language at all. They were simply computing the\nprobability of a single word given all the words that preceded it in a\nsentence. For example, by looking at pairs of English words they realized\nthat the word after \u201cthe\u201d was highly unlikely to be \u201cthe\u201d or \u201ca,\u201d somewhat\nmore likely to be \u201ccantaloupe,\u201d and still more likely to be \u201ctree.\u201d\n\u201cIt all hinged on Bayes\u2019 theorem,\u201d Mercer recalled. \u201cWe were given an\nacoustic output, and we\u2019d like to find the most probable word sequence,\ngiven the acoustic sequence that we heard.\u201d Their prior knowledge consisted\nof the most probable order of the words in an English sentence, which they\ncould get by studying enormous amounts of English text.\nThe big problem throughout the 1970s was finding enough data.

From them, IBM extracted about\nthree million pairs of sentences, almost 99% of which were actual\ntranslations of one another. It was a Rosetta Stone in English and French.\n\u201cYou had a day\u2019s worth of English and the corresponding day\u2019s worth of\nFrench, so things were lined up to that extent, but we didn\u2019t know that this\nsentence or word went with this or that sentence or word. For example,\nwhile the English shouted, \u2018Hear! Hear!,\u2019 the French said, \u2018Bravo!\u2019 So we\nbegan working on getting a better alignment of the sentences. We were using\nthe same methods as in speech recognition: Bayes\u2019 theorem and hidden\nMarkov models.\u201d The latter are particularly useful for recognizing patterns\nthat involve likely time sequences, for example, predicting one word in a\nsentence based on the previous word.\nIn a landmark paper in 1990 the group applied Bayes\u2019 theorem to full\nsentences. There was a small probability that the sentence, \u201cPresident\nLincoln was a good lawyer,\u201d means \u201cLe matin je me brosse les dents\u201d but a\nrelatively large probability that it means \u201cLe president Lincoln \u00e9tait un bon\navocat.\u201d After that paper, several of the leading machine translation systems\nincorporated Bayes\u2019 rule.\nIn 1993, lured by lucre and the challenge, Mercer and Brown moved from\nIBM and machine translation to RenTech, where they became vice presidents\nand co\u2013portfolio managers for technical trading.

The ability to accumulate evidence is an optimal survival strategy,\nbut our brains cannot assign a high priority to everything.

From that stream of data, 10 billion nerve cells extract\ninformation and correct prior understanding several times every 100\nmilliseconds. Discerning which sensory stimulus has caused which neuronal\nresponse is a difficult problem: the neurons fire unpredictably, scientists\ncannot monitor all of them at once, and the brain combines cues from\nmultiple sources. The vision regions of our brains, for example, create three-\ndimensional objects and scenes. To do so, they rely on our prior knowledge\nabout the regularities in our environment\u2014for example, that light generally\nshines from above and that straight lines and 90-degree angles are apt to be\nman-made. But our brains refine that knowledge with new data pouring in\nabout depth, contours, symmetry, lines of curvature, texture, shading,\nreflectance, foreshortening, and motion.\nIn 1998 the neurostatistician Emery N. Brown of MIT and Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital realized that Bayesian methods might deal with these\nuncertainties. Using Kalman filters, he and the MIT neuroscientist Matthew\nA. Wilson described a rat\u2019s brain as it processed information about the\nanimal\u2019s location in its environment. Approximately 30 so-called place\nneurons in the hippocampus keep a rat informed about its location. As a\nlaboratory rat foraged in a box scattered randomly with chocolate tidbits,\nelectrodes implanted in its brain imaged some of the place neurons as they\nfired. A Bayesian filter sequentially updated the rat\u2019s position in the box. The\nresearchers could see neither the rat nor its box, but by watching the neurons\nfire they could track the rat\u2019s movements. Thanks to Bayes, Brown could\nreconstruct the path of the chocolate-loving rat with only a fifth or a tenth of\nthe neurons that previous methods had required.\nTo explore the practicality of using the living brain to power prostheses\nand robots, Brown\u2019s statistical method was replicated with a few dozen\nmotor neurons, Bayesian algorithms, and Bayesian particle filters.

Does it maximize the\ninformation it gets from an uncertain world by performing Bayesian-like\ncomputations? In discussions of these questions, Bayes has become more\nthan just an aid for data analysis and decision making. It has become a\ntheoretical framework for explaining how the brain works. In fact, as such,\nthe \u201cBayesian Brain\u201d has become a metaphor for a human brain that mimics\nprobability.\nIn our struggle to survive in an uncertain and changing world, our sensory\nand motor systems often produce signals that are incomplete, ambiguous,\nvariable, or corrupted by random fluctuations. If we put one hand under a\ntable and estimate its location, we can be off by up to 10 centimeters. Every\ntime the brain generates a command for action, we produce a slightly\ndifferent movement. In this confusing world, Bayes has emerged as a useful\ntheoretical framework. It helps explain how the brain may learn. And it\ndemonstrates mathematically how we combine two kinds of information: our\nprior beliefs about the world with the error-fraught evidence from our\nsenses.\nAs Lindley emphasized years ago, if we are certain about the evidence\nrelayed by our senses, we rely on them. But when faced with unreliable\nsensory data, we fall back on our prior accumulation of beliefs about the\nworld.\nWhen Daniel Wolpert of Cambridge University tested the theory with a\nvirtual tennis game, he showed that players unconsciously combine their\nprior knowledge of bouncing balls in general with sensory data about a\nparticular ball coming over the net.

In short, growing\nevidence suggests that we have Bayesian brains.\nGiven Bayes\u2019 contentious past and prolific contributions, what will the future\nlook like?

Only the brain examines documents and\nimages according to their meaning and their content. Which approach will be\nmore useful? Will computers become so powerful that huge amounts of data\nalone will teach us everything? Will scientists no longer need to theorize or\nhypothesize before experimenting or gathering their data?

Here\u2019s a simple\nversion of the Bayesian calculation that lay at the very heart of the\ncontroversy.\nA 40-year-old woman without any symptoms or family history of breast\ncancer has a mammogram as part of a routine checkup. A week later she\nreceives a letter saying her test result was abnormal. She needs additional\ntesting. What is the probability she actually has breast cancer?\nQuite low.\nMany beginning statistics students\u2014and many physicians\u2014find this\nsurprising because mammograms, as a screening test, are reasonably\naccurate. They identify roughly 80% of 40-year-old women who have breast\ncancer at the time of their exam, and they provide positive test results to only\nabout 10% of women without the disease.\nHowever, breast cancer is relatively rare. And Bayes\u2019 rule takes back-\nground disease rates into account as prior knowledge. As a result, Bayes\nhighlights the fact that not everyone who gets a positive test for a disease\nactually has that disease. It also underscores the fact that the probability of\nbreast cancer is higher in a woman who finds a lump in her breast than in a\nwoman who has a mammogram as part of a routine checkup.\nTo illustrate:\n According to this formula, we need three pieces of information, which\nwill all go on the right-hand side of the equation:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1533, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "681d53c3-54c4-4c0a-a21d-da51aae4cb71": {"__data__": {"id_": "681d53c3-54c4-4c0a-a21d-da51aae4cb71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b06e7cc2-f29e-4944-8f3b-2dafce524808", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "b8f7323f6bba4de9ddb1e8374767ecab97f26baabcfedfe62b5a4672f868e4e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1.

Clerical dress is always difficult as\nthe robes and bands (collars) change very little over time. However, I\nwould say that the hair of the man . . . is quite wrong for the 1750s. He\nwould have been wearing a wig for a portrait. Clergymen wore a style\nof the bob wig (which eventually became known as a \u2018clerical wig\u2019), a\nshort very bushy wig of horsehair powdered white.\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1492, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b2321ed-d5e9-4d8f-aecb-019163a7fe03": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b2321ed-d5e9-4d8f-aecb-019163a7fe03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "291", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cc31d75-546f-4720-8f84-6084fec03d48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "291", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "upload\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-20"}, "hash": "84c2af6a26e36a67288709e0c7f1b51559ae60ec0941014741cd5f1eb50a3e45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2.
