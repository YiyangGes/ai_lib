It concerned a broader and more fundamental issue:\nhow we analyze evidence, change our minds as we get new information, and\nmake rational decisions in the face of uncertainty. And it was not resolved\nuntil the dawn of the twenty-first century.\nOn its face Bayes\u2019 rule is a simple, one-line theorem: by updating our\ninitial belief about something with objective new information, we get a new\nand improved belief. To its adherents, this is an elegant statement about\nlearning from experience. Generations of converts remember experiencing an\nalmost religious epiphany as they fell under the spell of its inner logic.\nOpponents, meanwhile, regarded Bayes\u2019 rule as subjectivity run amok.\nBayes\u2019 rule began life amid an inflammatory religious controversy in\nEngland in the 1740s: can we make rational conclusions about God based on\nevidence about the world around us? An amateur mathematician, the\nReverend Thomas Bayes, discovered the rule, and we celebrate him today as\nthe iconic father of mathematical decision making. Yet Bayes consigned his\ndiscovery to oblivion. In his time, he was a minor figure. And we know\nabout his work today only because of his friend and editor Richard Price, an\nalmost forgotten hero of the American Revolution.\nBy rights, Bayes\u2019 rule should be named for someone else: a Frenchman,\nPierre Simon Laplace, one of the most powerful mathematicians and\nscientists in history. To deal with an unprecedented torrent of data, Laplace\ndiscovered the rule on his own in 1774. Over the next forty years he\ndeveloped it into the form we use today.

Yet\nat the very same time practical problem solvers relied on it to deal with real-\nworld emergencies. One spectacular success occurred during the Second\nWorld War, when Alan Turing developed Bayes to break Enigma, the German\nnavy\u2019s secret code, and in the process helped to both save Britain and invent\nmodern electronic computers and software.

It was\nrediscovered independently by a different and far more renowned man,\nPierre Simon Laplace, who gave it its modern mathematical form and\nscientific application\u2014and then moved on to other methods. Although Bayes\u2019\nrule drew the attention of the greatest statisticians of the twentieth century,\nsome of them vilified both the method and its adherents, crushed it, and\ndeclared it dead. Yet at the same time, it solved practical questions that were\nunanswerable by any other means: the defenders of Captain Dreyfus used it\nto demonstrate his innocence; insurance actuaries used it to set rates; Alan\nTuring used it to decode the German Enigma cipher and arguably save the\nAllies from losing the Second World War; the U.S. Navy used it to search for\na missing H-bomb and to locate Soviet subs; RAND Corporation used it to\nassess the likelihood of a nuclear accident; and Harvard and Chicago\nresearchers used it to verify the authorship of the Federalist Papers. In\ndiscovering its value for science, many supporters underwent a near-\nreligious conversion yet had to conceal their use of Bayes\u2019 rule and pretend\nthey employed something else. It was not until the twenty-first century that the\nmethod lost its stigma and was widely and enthusiastically embraced. The\nstory began with a simple thought experiment.\nBecause Bayes\u2019 gravestone says he died in 1761 at the age of 59, we know\nhe lived during England\u2019s struggle to recover from nearly two centuries of\nreligious strife, civil war, and regicide.

As far as we know, no one else mentioned the essay for\nthe next 17 years, when Price would again bring Bayes\u2019 rule to light.\nBy modern standards, we should refer to the Bayes-Price rule. Price\ndiscovered Bayes\u2019 work, recognized its importance, corrected it, contributed\nto the article, and found a use for it. The modern convention of employing\nBayes\u2019 name alone is unfair but so entrenched that anything else makes little\nsense.\nAlthough it was ignored for years, Bayes\u2019 solution to the inverse\nprobability of causes was a masterpiece. He transformed probability from a\ngambler\u2019s measure of frequency into a measure of informed belief. A card\nplayer could start by believing his opponent played with a straight deck and\nthen modify his opinion each time a new hand was dealt. Eventually, the\ngambler could wind up with a better assessment of his opponent\u2019s honesty.\nBayes combined judgments based on prior hunches with probabilities\nbased on repeatable experiments. He introduced the signature features of\nBayesian methods: an initial belief modified by objective new information.\nHe could move from observations of the world to abstractions about their\nprobable cause. And he discovered the long-sought grail of probability, what\nfuture mathematicians would call the probability of causes, the principle of\ninverse probability, Bayesian statistics, or simply Bayes\u2019 rule.\nGiven the revered status of his work today, it is also important to\nrecognize what Bayes did not do. He did not produce the modern version of\nBayes\u2019 rule. He did not even employ an algebraic equation; he used\nNewton\u2019s old-fashioned geometric notation to calculate and add areas. Nor\ndid he develop his theorem into a powerful mathematical method. Above all,\nunlike Price, he did not mention Hume, religion, or God.\nInstead, he cautiously confined himself to the probability of events and did\nnot mention hypothesizing, predicting, deciding, or taking action. He did not\nsuggest possible uses for his work, whether in theology, science, or social\nscience.

His death in 1727 left\nLaplace\u2019s generation an enormous challenge: showing that gravitation was\nnot a hypothesis but a fundamental law of nature.\nAstronomy was the era\u2019s most quantified and respected science, and only\nit could test Newton\u2019s theories by explaining precisely how gravitation\naffects the movements of tides, interacting planets and comets, our moon, and\nthe shape of Earth and other planets. Forty years of empirical data had been\ncollected, but, as d\u2019Alembert warned, a single exception could bring the\nentire edifice tumbling down.\nThe burning scientific question of the day was whether the universe was\nstable. If Newton\u2019s gravitational force operates throughout the universe, why\ndon\u2019t the planets collide with each other and cause the cosmic Armageddon\ndescribed in the biblical book of Revelation? Was the end of the world at\nhand?\nAstronomers had long been aware of alarming evidence suggesting that the\nsolar system was inherently unstable. Comparing the actual positions of the\nmost remote known planets with centuries-old astronomical observations,\nthey could see that Jupiter was slowly accelerating in its orbit around the sun\nwhile Saturn was slowing down. Eventually, they thought, Jupiter would\nsmash into the sun, and Saturn would spin off into space. The problem of\npredicting the motions of many interacting bodies over long periods of time\nis complex even today, and Newton concluded that God\u2019s miraculous\nintervention kept the heavens in equilibrium. Responding to the challenge,\nLaplace decided to make the stability of the universe his lifework. He said\nhis tool would be mathematics and it would be like a telescope in the hands\nof an astronomer.\nFor a short time Laplace actually considered modifying Newton\u2019s theory\nby making gravity vary with a body\u2019s velocity as well as with its mass and\ndistance.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2272, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dca7bbe0-0392-4b3f-9077-1b80073000bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "dca7bbe0-0392-4b3f-9077-1b80073000bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11f0f86d-aaac-4ca5-a2df-59bcf7d1af39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "94e09d1921e193488bde80e4dbe285c72621ad02b531408247bae1c845bf0b29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd1ddc4d-e7a6-407b-9ad0-0e48a7139deb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "986c31e24a0e8954d2b4eee342ba218b39f995e2c53e8a40a5d327219bba2e41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Comparing the actual positions of the\nmost remote known planets with centuries-old astronomical observations,\nthey could see that Jupiter was slowly accelerating in its orbit around the sun\nwhile Saturn was slowing down.

In a paper submitted and read to the academy in\nMarch, the former abb\u00e9 compared ignorant mankind, not with God but with\nan imaginary intelligence capable of knowing All. Because humans can never\nknow everything with certainty, probability is the mathematical expression of\nour ignorance: \u201cWe owe to the frailty of the human mind one of the most\ndelicate and ingenious of mathematical theories, namely the science of\nchance or probabilities.\u201d7\nThe essay was a grand combination of mathematics, metaphysics, and the\nheavens that Laplace held to his entire life. His search for a probability of\ncauses and his view of the deity were deeply congenial. Laplace was all of\none piece and for that reason all the more formidable. He often said he did\nnot believe in God, and not even his biographer could decide whether he was\nan atheist or a deist. But his probability of causes was a mathematical\nexpression of the universe, and for the rest of his days he updated his theories\nabout God and the probability of causes as new evidence became available.\nLaplace was struggling with probability when one day, ten years after the\npublication of Bayes\u2019 essay, he picked up an astronomy journal and was\nshocked to read that others might be hot on the same trail. They were not, but\nthe threat of competition galvanized him.

The probability of causes was still useful in particularly uncertain\ncases because it was more powerful than frequentism. But science matured\nduring Laplace\u2019s lifetime. By the 1800s mathematicians had much more\nreliable data than they had had in his youth and dealing with trustworthy data\nwas easier with frequentism. Mathematicians did not learn until the\nmidtwentieth century that, even with great amounts of data, the two methods\ncan sometimes seriously disagree.\nLooking back in 1813 on his 40-year quest to develop the probability of\ncauses, Laplace described it as the primary method for researching unknown\nor complicated causes of natural phenomena. He referred to it fondly as his\nsource of large numbers and the inspiration behind his development and use\nof generating functions.\nAnd finally, in the climax of one small part of his career, he proved the\nelegant, general version of his theorem that we now call Bayes\u2019 rule. He had\nintuited its principle as a young man in 1774. In 1781 he found a way to use\nBayes\u2019 two-step process to derive the formula by making certain restrictive\nassumptions.

With it, the entire process of learning from evidence was\ndisplayed:\n In modern terms, the equation says that P(C|E), the probability of a\nhypothesis (given information), equals Pprior(C), our initial estimate of its\nprobability, times P(E|C), the probability of each new piece of information\n(under the hypothesis), divided by the sum of the probabilities of the data in\nall possible hypotheses.\nUndergraduates today study Laplace\u2019s first version of the equation, which\ndeals with discrete events such as coin tosses and births.

After that,\nFisher and I were great friends.\u201d45 For example, Jeffreys believed that\nFisher\u2019s maximum likelihood method was basically Bayesian, and he often\nused it because with large samples the prior did not matter and the two\ntechniques produced approximately the same results. They differed, however,\nwhen small amounts of data were involved. Years later others would\ndramatize situations where Jeffreys\u2019s and Fisher\u2019s significance test results\ncan differ by an order of magnitude.\nAside from their views on Bayes, Jeffreys and Fisher had much in\ncommon. Both were practicing scientists who manipulated statistical data;\nneither was a mathematician or statistician. Both were educated at\nCambridge; Jeffreys, in fact, never left and was a fellow there for 75 years,\nlonger than any other professor. Neither man was outgoing; both were\nappalling lecturers, their feeble voices inaudible beyond a few rows, and a\nstudent once counted Jeffreys mumbling \u201cer\u201d 71 times in five minutes. Both\nwere knighted for their work.\nOf the two, Jeffreys led the richer personal life. At the age of 49 he\nmarried his longtime collaborator, the mathematician Bertha Swirles; they\nproofread their monumental Methods of Mathematical Physics during all-\nnight stints as air raid wardens during the Second World War. He enjoyed\nannotating discrepancies in detective novels, singing tenor in choral\nsocieties, botanizing, walking, traveling, and, until he was 91, bicycling to\nwork.\nLike Laplace, Jeffreys studied the formation of the Earth and planets in\norder to understand the origin of the solar system. He became involved in\nstatistics because he was interested in how earthquake waves travel through\nthe Earth.

Quantum mechanics was new\nand chic, and Bayes was not.\nIn addition, Fisher\u2019s techniques, written in a popular style with minimal\nmathematics, were easier to apply than those of Jeffreys. A biologist or\npsychologist could easily use Fisher\u2019s manual to determine whether results\nwere statistically significant. To use Jeffreys\u2019s rather opaque and\nmathematical approach, a scientist had to choose among five nuanced\ncategories: the evidence against the hypothesis is \u201cnot worth more than a\nbare mention\u201d or it is substantial, strong, very strong, or decisive.57\nCharacteristically, Jeffreys tucked the five categories into appendix B of his\nbook.\nFinally and most important, Jeffreys was interested in making inferences\nfrom scientific evidence, not in using statistics to guide future action. To him,\ndecision making\u2014so important for the rise of mathematical statistics during\nthe Second World War and the Cold War\u2014was irrelevant. Others parted at\nthe same divide: a big reason for the feud between Fisher and Neyman, for\nexample, was decision theory.\nAll these factors left Jeffreys almost totally isolated from statistical\ntheorists. His link with Fisher was their interest in applying statistics to\nscience. Jeffreys knew Ramsey and visited him as he was dying in the\nhospital, but neither realized the other was working on probability theory; in\nany case, Jeffreys was interested in scientific inference and Ramsey in\ndecision making.

By war\u2019s end, a naval Enigma machine could be set up an\nastronomical number of ways. According to a Bletchley Park decoder, \u201cAll\nthe coolies in China could experiment for months without reading a single\nmessage.\u201d6 At any one time the machine could use 1 of 4 reflector\ncombinations (each of which could be set in 26 different ways); 3 of 8 rotors\n(giving up to 336 permutations); more than 150 billion plugboard\ncombinations; 17,000 possible clip positions around the rotors; and 17,000\npossible starting positions (half a million in four-rotor machines). Many of\nthese settings were changed every two days, sometimes every 8 or 24 hours.\nAccording to Frank Birch, head of the GC&CS naval intelligence branch,\nsuperior officers informed him that the \u201cGerman codes were unbreakable. I\nwas told it wasn\u2019t worthwhile putting pundits onto them. . . . Defeatism at the\nbeginning of the war, to my mind, played a large part in delaying the breaking\nof the codes.\u201d7 The naval codes were assigned to one officer and one clerk;\nnot a single cryptanalyst was involved. Birch, however, thought the naval\nEnigma could be broken because it had to be. The U-boats put Britain\u2019s very\nexistence at stake.\nTuring had still another attitude.

Supplying Great Britain immediately became\nmore difficult. When American ships that had protected the convoys\nsupplying Britain were quickly transferred to the Pacific, 15 German U-boats\ntook their places in the shipping lanes off the American East Coast.

The U-boats, lying in wait at periscope depth, caused three\nmonths of devastation until the U.S. military ordered coastal lights turned off\nat dusk.\nMaking matters worse, the Atlantic U-boats added a fourth wheel to their\nEnigmas, and the Turing-Welchman bombes were stymied. For most of 1942\nTuring and his coworkers could not read any message to or from German\nsubmarines. Bletchley Park called it the Great Blackout. For four months the\nU-boats ran riot in the Atlantic at large, sinking 43 ships in August and\nSeptember alone. The average U.S. vessel crossed the Atlantic and back\nthree times before it was sunk on its fourth trip.\nFinally, in December 1942, three young British crewmen, Lt.

He later said that\ncomputers would have been irrelevant.\nApplying his theories, Koopman wrote a fat manual of precomputed\nrecipes for conducting a U-boat search. The effort needed for each\nsubsection of the search area equaled the logarithm of the probability at that\npoint. The regions to be searched did not have to be boxes or circles; they\ncould have squiggly, irregular shapes. But using his formulas, he could tell a\ncommander how many hours of search to devote to each squiggly region.\nUsing Koopman\u2019s cookbook, a shipboard officer could lay out the optimal\nway to search given his limited resources: the expected time needed to find\nthe target; the boundaries beyond which he should not venture; and what he\nshould do every two hours until either the U-boat was found or the search\nwas called off. He could plan an eight-hour day, starting off with an optimum\nsearch for the first four hours; then, if a U-boat had not been found, the\ncommander could use Bayes\u2019 rule to update the target\u2019s probable location\nand launch a new plan every two hours to maximize his chance of locating it.\nAll of the commander\u2019s planning for two-hour sequential searches could\nbe done ahead of time in his stateroom. Koopman called it a \u201ccontinuous\ndistribution of effort.\u201d His U-boat sea searches were theoretically similar to\nKolmogorov\u2019s artillery problem. Koopman was searching for an unknown U-\nboat and needed to spread the search effort over an area in an optimal way,\njust as Kolmogorov figured the optimal amount of dispersion in order to\ndestroy a German cannon.

Americans were\nbuying more cars and driving more miles, but laws had not kept pace.

As Savage explained, when he wrote the book he was \u201cnot yet a\npersonalistic Bayesian.\u201d He thought he came to Bayesian statistics \u201cseriously\nonly through recognition of the likelihood principle; and it took me a year or\ntwo to make the transition.\u201d21\nAccording to the likelihood principle, all the information in experimental\ndata gets encapsulated in the likelihood portion of Bayes\u2019 theorem, the part\ndescribing the probability of objective new data; the prior played no role.\nPractically speaking, the principle greatly streamlined analysis. Scientists\ncould stop running an experiment when they were satisfied with the result or\nran out of time, money, and patience; nonBayesians had to continue until\nsome frequency criterion was met. Bayesians would also be able to\nconcentrate on what happened, not on what could have happened according\nto Neyman-Pearson\u2019s sampling plan.\nThe transition to Bayes took Savage several years, but by the early 1960s\nhe had accepted its logic wholeheartedly, fusing subjective probability with\nnew statistical tools for scientific inference and decision making. As far as\nSavage was concerned, Bayes\u2019 rule filled a need that other statistical\nprocedures could not.

According to Doll, Fisher even went so far as to accuse\nHill of scientific dishonesty. Over the course of three years Fisher developed\ntwo remarkable hypotheses. The first, believe it or not, was that lung cancer\nmight cause smoking. The second was that a latent genetic factor might give\nsome people hereditary predilections for both smoking and lung cancer. In\nneither case would smoking cause lung cancer.\nCornfield maintained a running argument with Fisher through the 1950s.\nCornfield was already thinking deeply about the standards of evidence\nneeded before observational data could establish cause and effect.

He chose Bayes\u2019 rule and used cardiovascular\ndeath rates as the prior. Framingham gave him data about two groups of\npeople, those who had died of heart disease and those who had not. Within\neach group he had information about seven risk factors. Calculating Bayes\u2019\nrule, he got a posterior probability in the form of a logistic regression\nfunction, which he then used to identify the four most important risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease. In addition to age itself, they were cholesterol,\ncigarette smoking, heart abnormalities, and blood pressure.\nBayes allowed Cornfield to reframe Framingham\u2019s data in terms of the\nprobability that people with particular characteristics would get heart\ndisease. There was no critical level for cholesterol or blood pressure below\nwhich people were safe and above which they got the disease.

Bayes\u2019 rule was emerging in fits and starts from the secrecy\nof the Second World War and the Cold War.\nThe H-bomb problem facing Madansky was politically and statistically\ntricky. No atomic or hydrogen weapon had ever exploded accidentally. In the\n12 years since the United States had dropped atomic bombs on Japan in\nAugust 1945, nuclear bombs had been detonated, but always deliberately, as\npart of a weapons test. Barring accidents, the nation\u2019s leaders believed that\ntheir stocks of nuclear weapons deterred all chance of thermonuclear war\u2014\nand that accidents could not occur in the future because none had occurred in\nthe past. Nonetheless, the question remained: could the impossible happen?\nAccording to more than a century of conventional statistics, the impossible\ncould not be calculated. Jakob Bernoulli had decreed in 1713 that highly\nimprobable events do not happen. David Hume agreed, arguing that because\nthe sun had risen thousands of times in the past it would continue to do so. It\nwas Thomas Bayes\u2019 friend and editor, Richard Price, who took the contrary\nview that the highly improbable could still occur. During the nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries, Antoine-Augustin Cournot concluded that the\nprobability of a physically impossible event was infinitely small and thus the\nevent would never occur.

So, as Box said, \u201cComparing\naverages looked right to me until Stein.\u201d5\nStein\u2019s Paradox called those averages into question. Charles Stein, a\ntheoretical statistician, had been thinking about something that looked quite\nsimple: estimating a mean. Statisticians do not concern themselves with\nindividuals; their bread and butter is a midvalue summarizing large amounts\nof information. The centuries-old question was which midvalue works best\nfor a particular problem.

Statisticians called it Stein\u2019s Paradox. Stein called it\nshrinkage. As a frequency-based theorist, he studiously avoided discussing\nits relationship with Bayes.\nStein\u2019s Paradox, however, works for comparisons between related\nstatistics: the egg production of different chicken breeds, the batting averages\nof various baseball players, or the workers\u2019 compensation exposure of\nroofing companies. Traditionally, for example, farmers comparing the egg\nproduction of five chicken breeds would average the egg yields of each\nbreed separately. But what if a traveling salesman advertised a breed of\nhens, and each one supposedly laid a million eggs? Because of their prior\nknowledge of poultry, farmers would laugh him out of town. Bayesians\ndecided that Stein, like the farmers, had weighted his average with a sort of\nsuper-or hyperdistribution about chicken-ness, information about egg laying\ninherent in each breed but never before considered. And intrinsic to poultry\nfarming is the fact that one hen never lays a million eggs.\nIn like manner, Stein\u2019s system used prior information to explain the\nhitherto mediocre batter who begins a new season hitting a spectacular .400.\nStein\u2019s Paradox tells fans not to forget their previous knowledge of the sport\nand the batting averages of other players.\nWhen Stein and Willard D.

He had introduced it as an alternative to Bayes\u2019\nrule during an argument with Karl Pearson in 1930.

Lindley\u2019s Paradox occurs when a precise hypothesis is\ntested with vast amounts of data. In 1987, Princeton University aeronautics\nengineering professor Robert G. Jahn conducted a large study which he\nconcluded supported the existence of psychokinetic powers. He reported that\na random event generator had produced 104,490,000 trials testing the\nhypothesis that someone on a couch eight feet away cannot influence their\nresults any more than random chance would. Jahn reported that the random\nevent generator produced 18,471 more examples (0.018%) of human\ninfluence on his sensitive microelectronic equipment than could be expected\nwith chance alone. Even with a p-value as small as 0.00015, the frequentist\nwould reject the hypothesis (and conclude in favor of psychokinetic powers)\nwhile the same evidence convinces a Bayesian that the hypothesis against\nspiritualism is almost certainly true.\nSix years later, Jimmie Savage, Harold Lindman, and Ward Edwards at the\nUniversity of Michigan showed that results using Bayes and the frequentist\u2019s\np-values could differ by significant amounts even with everyday-sized data\nsamples; for instance, a Bayesian with any sensible prior and a sample of\nonly 20 would get an answer ten times or more larger than the p-value.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1965, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d38c65df-ca3d-4554-9a7e-93976f6ba5d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d38c65df-ca3d-4554-9a7e-93976f6ba5d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "082c7b5f-d985-4e51-9490-661474e187bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "fc0b657d011394e2560deee4cfa94c3d68c02339664048bf432ae5320d9be983", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d3f7bf0-b5cf-4807-87fd-c77aa0e9e671", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "0e1bf2216ca39c2e5cb426187c9fc18d3b842e52cf84c1cbe5441e556b2359d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Jahn reported that the random\nevent generator produced 18,471 more examples (0.018%) of human\ninfluence on his sensitive microelectronic equipment than could be expected\nwith chance alone.

But frequentism offered businesses no help when it\ncame to issues like launching a new product or changing a price.\nSchlaifer\u2019s publications later described modest pleas for help from a\nnewsstand owner unsure of how many copies of the Daily Racing Form to\nstock, and from a wholesaler worried about allocating his ten delivery trucks\nbetween two warehouses. With luck, business owners might make the right\ndecisions. But given the uncertainties involved in even these simple\nproblems, Schlaifer wondered how they could ever hope to systematically\nmake the best possible choices. Even if they could collect additional\ninformation by sampling or experimentation, would it be worth the cost?\nAccording to frequentists, objective statistics were synonymous with long-\nrun relative frequency, and probabilities were invalid unless based on\nrepeatable observations. Frequentists dealt with a rich abundance of directly\nrelevant data and took samples to test hypotheses and draw inferences about\nunknowns. The method worked for repetitive, standardized phenomena such\nas successive grain crops, genetics, gambling, insurance, and statistical\nmechanics.\nBut business executives often had to make decisions under conditions of\nextreme uncertainty, without sample data. As Schlaifer realized, \u201cUnder\nuncertainty, the businessman is forced, in effect, to gamble, . . . hoping that he\nwill win but knowing that he may lose.\u201d4 Executives needed a way to assess\nprobabilities without the repeated trials required by frequentist methods.\nSchlaifer said teaching frequentism made him feel like a jackass. It simply\ndid not address the main problem in business: decision making under\nuncertainty.\nThinking through the problem, Schlaifer wondered how executives could\nmake decisions based on no data. Whatever prior information they had about\nthe demand for their product was obviously better than none.

His work would have a large impact on many mathematical\nstatisticians and decision theorists, including Raiffa.\nUntil Wald\u2019s book appeared, the word \u201cBayesian\u201d had referred only to\nThomas Bayes\u2019 controversial suggestion about equal priors, not to his\ntheorem for solving inverse probability problems. After Wald died in a plane\ncrash in India in 1950, the Columbia University statistics department hired\nRaiffa to teach Wald\u2019s course. Raiffa kept a day ahead of his students by\nreading the textbook every night. He was moving gradually toward a\nviewpoint opposed by almost every statistics department in the country,\nincluding Columbia\u2019s. Giving up \u201cscientific\u201d objectivity and embracing\nsubjectivity would not be easy.\nAt first, like Schlaifer, Raiffa taught straight frequentism, using the\nthencanonical Neyman-Pearson theory, tests of hypotheses, confidence\nintervals, and unbiased estimation. But by 1955, Raiffa, like Schlaifer, no\nlonger believed these concepts were central. Columbia faculty members\nwere auditing Raiffa\u2019s lectures, and his transformation into a closet Bayesian\nleft him a nervous wreck. He did not \u201ccome out\u201d because colleagues whom\nhe admired greatly were vociferously opposed to Bayesianism. \u201cLook,\nHoward, what are you trying to do?\u201d they asked. \u201cAre you trying to introduce\nsquishy judgmental, psychological stuff into something which we think is\nscience?\u201d12\nHe and his Columbia colleagues were working on totally different kinds of\nproblems.

Thus, if you start with normal Gaussians, you\u2019ll end up with\nnormal Gaussians. Conjugate priors paid dividends with the repeated\nupdating called for by Bayes\u2019 method. Albert Madansky used a similar\nconcept for his H-bomb study. The shortcut would later become unnecessary\nwith the adoption of Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods.\nIn a further simplification, some business Bayesians even dropped the\nprior odds called for by Bayes\u2019 rule.

DuPont, trying to decide how\nbig a factory to build for artificial shoe leather in 1962, was delighted to\nassess the prior odds of the demand for its new product. Design engineers at\nFord Motor Company were equally pleased that incorporating their opinions\ninto Bayes\u2019 prior let Ford use smaller opinion samples. Their work opened\nup just about any business problem to mathematical analysis. An engineering\nproblem might have 20 sources of uncertainty; of these, perhaps 12 could be\nhandled by single guesses; 5 needed more testing; and 2 might be so critical\nthat experts had to be interviewed. Bayes\u2019 rule was solving far more\ncomplex problems than Savage\u2019s mental exercises about curling rabbit ears.\nBetween 1961 and 1965 an exciting weekly seminar, generally followed\nby drinks in Schlaifer\u2019s office, focused on decision making under uncertainty\n(DUU for short). The seminar explored utility analysis, portfolio analysis,\ngroup decision processes, theory of syndicates, behavioral anomalies, and\nways to ask about uncertainties and values. Said Raiffa, \u201cWe helped shape a\nfield.\u201d30 The seminar and two books Raiffa and Schlaifer cowrote during this\nperiod spurred the Bayesian revival of the 1960s. Raiffa was later surprised\nto realize that the most fertile period of his collaboration with Schlaifer had\nlasted only four years.\nRaiffa\u2019s and Schlaifer\u2019s classic book for advanced statisticians, Applied\nStatistical Decision Theory, was published in 1961.

As their calculations became increasingly\ncomplicated, Wallace developed new algebraic methods for dealing with\ndifficult integrals; his asymptotic approximations would form much of the\nproject\u2019s statistical meat.\nMosteller and Wallace adopted another important simplification. In-stead\nof using the mathematical vocabulary of probabilities, they adopted the\neveryday language of odds. They were expert mathematicians, but they found\nodds easier computationally and intuitively.\nDuring the decade it took to analyze The Federalist, Mosteller kept busy\non a number of fronts. His back-to-back investigations of the Truman election\nand the Kinsey report had turned him into the person to call when something\nwent wrong. Over the years Harvard would ask Mosteller to chair four\ndepartments: social relations (as acting chair); statistics (as its founder); and,\nin the university\u2019s School of Public Health, first biostatistics and then health\npolicy and management.\nHe persuaded Harvard (\u201cVERY SLOWLY,\u201d he wrote a friend)3 to\nestablish the statistics department. Joining the 1950s and 1960s push to apply\nmathematical models to social problems, he researched game theory,\ngambling, and learning, where Bayes\u2019 theorem itself was not used but served\nas a metaphor for thinking and accommodating new ideas. Eventually,\nMosteller\u2019s interest in those fields waned, and he moved on to other\npastures. Education remained a major interest. As part of the government\u2019s\npost-Sputnik push to teach students at every level about probability,\nMosteller wrote two textbooks about frequentism and Bayes\u2019 rule for high\nschool students. In 1961 he taught probability and statistics on NBC\u2019s early-\nmorning Continental Classroom series; his lectures were viewed by more\nthan a million people and taken for credit by 75,000. In medical research\nMosteller pioneered meta-analysis and strongly advocated randomized\nclinical trials, fair tests of medical treatments, and data-based medicine.

By 2:30 a.m., though,\nTukey and his colleagues were ready to call him the winner. The pressure\nwas too much for NBC. Network executives hustled the statisticians into a\nroom without telephones, locked them in and refused to let them out until 8\na.m. Tukey and his team twiddled their thumbs all night, unable to release\ntheir results until morning, when it was clear Kennedy had won. Still, Tukey\nhad prevented NBC from mistakenly declaring Nixon the winner. Relieved\nand impressed, the network asked him to assemble a team for the\ncongressional election in 1962.

I\u2019m not in a position to speak of that but I. J. Good is the\nprincipal contributor to the Bayesian group and he was taking that\nposition.\u201d29 Good was Alan Turing\u2019s cryptographic assistant during the\nSecond World War. So did Tukey use Bayes\u2019 rule for decoding for the\nNational Security Agency? And could he have been distancing himself from\nBayesian methods in order to protect work there?\nThe ties between Tukey, Bayes, and top-secret decoding are many and\nclose. Bayes\u2019 rule is a natural for decoders who have some initial guesses\nand must minimize the time or cost to reach a solution; it has been widely\nused for decoding ever since Bletchley Park.

The study had even identified the\nsequence of events that ultimately caused the accident.\nNot until 1981 did two industry-supported studies finally employ Bayes\u2019\ntheorem\u2014and admit it. Analysts used it to combine the probabilities of\nequipment failures with specific information from two particular power\nplants: Zion Nuclear Power Station north of Chicago and Indian Point reactor\non the Hudson River, 24 miles north of New York City. Since then,\nquantitative risk analysis methods and probabilistic safety studies have used\nboth frequentist and Bayesian methods to analyze safety in the chemical\nindustry, nuclear power plants, hazardous waste repositories, the release of\nradioactive material from nuclear power plants, the contamination of Mars\nby terrestrial microorganisms, the destruction of bridges, and exploration for\nmineral deposits. To industry\u2019s relief, risk analysis is also now identifying\nso-called unuseful safety regulations that can presumably be abandoned.\nSubjective judgment still bothers many physical scientists and engineers\nwho dislike mixing objective and subjective information in science.\nAvoiding the word \u201cBayes,\u201d however, is no longer necessary\u2014or an option.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1923, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14156c7f-d0f2-4287-a1f7-47624686232a": {"__data__": {"id_": "14156c7f-d0f2-4287-a1f7-47624686232a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2e22787-b2a9-4cc2-8e4a-745faaf364ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "db49404d6a6c87b44539991b698c219cf9b1837b95a899bbcfee398188df8c42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "15.\n \nthe navy searches\n \nSurprisingly, given Bayes\u2019 success in fighting U-boats during the Second\nWorld War, the U.S. Navy embraced the method slowly and grudgingly\nduring the Cold War.

The young man was amazed to see Craven and\nother senior officers milling around, opening doors for him.\nAlmost daily planning sessions with the military soon convinced the\nmathematicians that their goal\u2014using Bayes\u2019 rule and updating to find the H-\nbomb\u2014was not the reason they were hired. Bayes was window dressing. If\nthe H-bomb was not found, the navy wanted to be able to prove statistically\nthat it was not there. \u201cThe general thrust seemed to be to come up with a\ncredible certification to the President that the H-bomb could not be found,\nrather than proceeding with an expectation that it could be found.

And in doing so he\ndiscovered a remarkable, hitherto unknown event in British history. Raftery\u2019s\nBayesian analysis revealed that accident rates plummeted suddenly in the late\n1880s or early 1890s. A historian friend suggested why. In 1889, British\nminers had formed the militant Miners\u2019 Federation (which later became the\nNational Union of Mine Workers). Safety was their number one issue. Almost\novernight, coal mines got safer.\n\u201cIt was a Eureka moment,\u201d Raftery said. \u201cIt was quite a thrill. And without\nBayesian statistics, it would have been much harder to do a test of this\nhypothesis.\u201d5 Frequency-based statistics worked well when one hypothesis\nwas a special case of the other and both assumed gradual behavior. But when\nhypotheses were competing and neither was a special case of the other,\nfrequentism was not as helpful, especially with data involving abrupt\nchanges\u2014like the formation of a militant union.\nRaftery wound up publishing two papers in 1986 about modeling abrupt\nrate changes. His first, frequentist paper was long, dense, and virtually\nunread. His second, Bayesian paper was shorter, simpler, and had a much\ngreater impact.

A popular Mother\u2019s Day gift at the time was a Whitman\u2019s Sampler\nassortment of chocolate bonbons; a diagram inside the box top identified the\nfilling hidden inside each candy. To Geman, the diagram was a matrix of\nunknown but enticing variables. \u201cLet\u2019s call it Gibbs sampler,\u201d he said, after\nJosiah Willard Gibbs, a nineteenth-century American physicist who applied\nstatistical methods to physical systems.7\nThe dots were starting to connect. But the Gemans, like Besag, operated in\na small niche field, spatial statistics. And instead of nibbling at their problem\na pixel at a time, the Gemans tried gobbling it whole. Working at pixel levels\non a 64 x 64-cell fragment of a photo, they produced too many unknowns for\ncomputers of the day to digest. They wrote up their sampler in a formidably\ndifficult paper and published it in 1984 in IEEE Transactions on Pattern\nAnalysis and Machine Intelligence. Specialists in image processing, neural\nnetworks, and expert systems quickly adopted the method, which, with\ncomputers gaining more power every year, also sparked the interest of some\nstatisticians. The brothers spent the next year racing around the globe giving\ninvited talks.\nDonald Geman used the Gibbs sampler to improve satellite images; Stuart\nused it for medical scans. Several years later, statisticians outside the small\nspatial imaging community began to realize that more general versions could\nbe useful. The Gibbs sampler\u2019s flexibility and reliability would make it the\nmost popular Monte Carlo algorithm.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2146, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "817cbc44-c6dd-4edc-8af1-708ff51e1bd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "817cbc44-c6dd-4edc-8af1-708ff51e1bd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86872763-95d3-4eac-95f1-9fb242bf4119", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "a870a0353d747c7439efaecc44234916c9ebc52f57af41e1f6ca0163eb90d8e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "54156400-991b-4b77-bf5d-8b068cbac95a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "4a2c6710554da74a363c0fb0fa55b2c9ab73f4a6b0e309557ea99a32f143a270", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Working at pixel levels\non a 64 x 64-cell fragment of a photo, they produced too many unknowns for\ncomputers of the day to digest.

Once\nothers thought about it, they\u2019d realize the importance of the method too.\nWhen Smith spoke at a workshop in Quebec in June 1989, he showed that\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo could be applied to almost any statistical\nproblem. It was a revelation.

Using it, the committee could assign uncertainties to all their data and\naugment visual sightings with recordings of whales vocalizing near\nunderwater hydrophones.\nProvidentially, the spring of 1993 was a rewarding year for bowhead\ncounting, and sightings plus vocalizing showed that the whales were almost\nassuredly increasing at a healthy rate. Their recovery indicated that\nprotecting other great whale populations from commercial whaling might\nhelp them recover too.\nThe entire process\u2014involving rival Bayesian and frequentist methods and\nwhaling factions that often profoundly disagreed\u2014could have been wildly\ncontentious. But times were changing. Pragmatism ruled. Making fullscale\nBayesian analyses to combine visual and acoustical data was expensive, and\nthus, because they confirmed previous frequentist studies, they were\ndiscontinued. Raftery moved on to using Bayes for 48-hour weather\nforecasting.\nOther wildlife researchers picked up the Bayesian banner. When Paul R.\nWade decided in 1988 to use Bayes for his Ph.D. thesis, he said, \u201cI was off\nin this small area of marine mammal biology but I felt as if I were in the\ncenter of a revolution in science.\u201d Ten years later, at the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration, he was comparing frequentist and Bayesian\nanalyses of a small, isolated population of 200 or 300 beluga whales in the\nArctic and Sub-Arctic waters of Cook Inlet, Alaska.

As\npart of this endeavor, linguists like Noam Chomsky developed structural\nrules for English sentences, subjects, verbs, adjectives, and grammar but\nfailed to produce an algorithm that could explain why one string of words\nmakes an English sentence while another string does not.\nDuring the 1970s IBM had two competing teams working on a similar\nproblem, speech recognition. One group, filled with linguists, studied the\nrules of grammar. The other group, led by Mercer and Brown, who later went\nto RenTech, was filled with mathematically inclined communications\nspecialists, computer scientists, and engineers. They took a different tack,\nreplaced logical grammar with Bayes\u2019 rule, and were ignored for a decade.\nMercer\u2019s ambition was to make computers do intelligent things, and voice\nrecognition seemed to be the way to make this happen. For both Mercer and\nBrown speech recognition was a problem about taking a signal that had\npassed through a noisy channel like a telephone and then determining the\nmost probable sentence that the speaker had in mind. Ignoring grammar rules,\nthey decided to figure out the statistical probability that words and phrases in\none language would wind up as particular words or phrases in another.

From them, IBM extracted about\nthree million pairs of sentences, almost 99% of which were actual\ntranslations of one another. It was a Rosetta Stone in English and French.\n\u201cYou had a day\u2019s worth of English and the corresponding day\u2019s worth of\nFrench, so things were lined up to that extent, but we didn\u2019t know that this\nsentence or word went with this or that sentence or word. For example,\nwhile the English shouted, \u2018Hear! Hear!,\u2019 the French said, \u2018Bravo!\u2019 So we\nbegan working on getting a better alignment of the sentences. We were using\nthe same methods as in speech recognition: Bayes\u2019 theorem and hidden\nMarkov models.\u201d The latter are particularly useful for recognizing patterns\nthat involve likely time sequences, for example, predicting one word in a\nsentence based on the previous word.\nIn a landmark paper in 1990 the group applied Bayes\u2019 theorem to full\nsentences.

The\nmonkey\u2019s control was so precise it could reach out with the robotic arm, nab\nthe treat, and fetch it back to eat.

Does it maximize the\ninformation it gets from an uncertain world by performing Bayesian-like\ncomputations? In discussions of these questions, Bayes has become more\nthan just an aid for data analysis and decision making. It has become a\ntheoretical framework for explaining how the brain works. In fact, as such,\nthe \u201cBayesian Brain\u201d has become a metaphor for a human brain that mimics\nprobability.\nIn our struggle to survive in an uncertain and changing world, our sensory\nand motor systems often produce signals that are incomplete, ambiguous,\nvariable, or corrupted by random fluctuations. If we put one hand under a\ntable and estimate its location, we can be off by up to 10 centimeters. Every\ntime the brain generates a command for action, we produce a slightly\ndifferent movement.

The public\nreaction was immediate\u2014and in large part\u2014enraged. Here\u2019s a simple\nversion of the Bayesian calculation that lay at the very heart of the\ncontroversy.\nA 40-year-old woman without any symptoms or family history of breast\ncancer has a mammogram as part of a routine checkup. A week later she\nreceives a letter saying her test result was abnormal. She needs additional\ntesting. What is the probability she actually has breast cancer?\nQuite low.\nMany beginning statistics students\u2014and many physicians\u2014find this\nsurprising because mammograms, as a screening test, are reasonably\naccurate. They identify roughly 80% of 40-year-old women who have breast\ncancer at the time of their exam, and they provide positive test results to only\nabout 10% of women without the disease.\nHowever, breast cancer is relatively rare. And Bayes\u2019 rule takes back-\nground disease rates into account as prior knowledge. As a result, Bayes\nhighlights the fact that not everyone who gets a positive test for a disease\nactually has that disease. It also underscores the fact that the probability of\nbreast cancer is higher in a woman who finds a lump in her breast than in a\nwoman who has a mammogram as part of a routine checkup.\nTo illustrate:\n According to this formula, we need three pieces of information, which\nwill all go on the right-hand side of the equation:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1533, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cebbf09d-b430-426f-8c28-25da5f2912a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "cebbf09d-b430-426f-8c28-25da5f2912a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f3d8c83-42ab-4caf-b6bb-0e3faf380494", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "theory_never_die.pdf", "file_path": "books\\theory_never_die.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-27"}, "hash": "a48c8d11f3b0fb24bb5f0b34192c7be37e9c6d42c3ed4d931acab350cb1dec5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1. The probability of having breast cancer: This is our prior knowledge\nabout the background disease rate of breast cancer among women in\ntheir forties at the time they get a mammogram. Ac-cording to Cancer\nand Jama, this is approximately 4/10 of 1%. Thus out of every\n10,000 women in their forties who have mammograms, we can\nestimate that approximately 40 actually have the disease. The\nnumber: 40/10,000.\n2. The probability of a breast cancer patient getting a positive\nmammogram: According to the National Cancer Institute and\nevidence from mammography, approximately 32 of those 40 women\nwith breast cancer will get a positive test result from the\nmammogram. The number: 32/10,000.\n3. The probability of getting a positive mammogram: The total number\nof women who get positive results (whether or not cancer is present)\ninclude women with cancer and women who are falsely informed that\nthey have the disease. Mammograms give a positive (\u201cabnormal\u201d)\nresult to some women who do not have the disease; they are called\nfalse positives. For mammography, this rate is quite high,\napproximately 10%, according to the New England Journal of\nMedicine. Thus out of 10,000 women in their forties, 996 will get a\nletter telling them they have an abnormal test result. To rule out breast\ncancer, these women will need more mammography, ultrasound, or\ntissue sampling, perhaps even a biopsy. To this number must be\nadded the 32 breast cancer patients per 10,000 who will get a\npositive mammogram. The total number: 1028/10,000 or a little more\nthan 10% of the women screened.\nInserting these numbers into the formula, we get the following:\n Doing the arithmetic produces 0.03, or 3%. Thus the probability that a\nwoman who tests positive has breast cancer is only 3%. She has 97 chances\nout of 100 to be disease free.\nNone of this is static.

Bayes was\ninterred on April 15, which is often called the date of his death. The\ndegraded condition of his vault may have contributed to the\nconfusion.\nSecond, the often-reproduced portrait of Thomas Bayes is almost\nassuredly of someone else named \u201cT. Bayes.\u201d The sketch first appeared\nin 1936 in History of Life Insurance in its Formative Years by Terence\nO\u2019Donnell.

Bayes, Improver of the Columnar Method developed by\nBarrett,\u201d and Barrett did not develop his method until 1810, a half-\ncentury after the death of \u201cour\u201d Rev. Thomas Bayes.\nBellhouse (2004) first noticed that the portrait\u2019s hairstyle is\nanachronistic.
